  "notes": "even though i live somewhere it rarely snows, i’ve always dreamed of a quiet, storybook town where snow falls on winter nights. that’s what inspired this piece. whenever i hold this hot water bottle in its hand-knit cover, it gives me a gentle, comforting sense of warmth and emotional support.\r\n\r\nsize: cover will fit 31.5cm × 20.5cm hot water bottle\r\n(if you want to make it wider or narrower, just add or take away 18 stitches. to make it longer or shorter, you can add or remove some of the snowflake patterns in the middle.)\r\n\r\nconstruction:\r\nthe cover is worked from the bottom up, beginning with judy’s magic cast-on. increases are worked on both sides to shape the base, followed by the colorwork chart section. decreases are then worked on both sides, and the piece is finished with a ribbed collar knit in the round.\r\n\r\n中文版本请看我的小红书：season今晚不通宵",
