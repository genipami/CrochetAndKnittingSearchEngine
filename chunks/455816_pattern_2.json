    "content": "only recommend this for the large single loop or for a double loop you can cast on a multiple of 6 stitch counts are indicated for the large loop work the first round as k5 pfb and then work the other rounds as k5 p2 making the cowl cast on the number of stitches you need for your yarn and the size you want to make see table keep the cast-on firm and even i recommend using cable cast-on and joining after the first round i find it s easier to join without twisting this way you need to leave enough of a yarn end so that you can join together the first and last stitch of the first round as you weave in the end you can use other cast-ons - just be sure not to twist as you join if you want to get a smooth cabled edge using long-tail cast-on join before you work the first round work in rounds - all rounds are the same *k5 p2 - repeat from * until you are ready to bind-off you can mark the end of the round with a marker - or knit without a marker and just look for the tail to find where to start the bind-off tip if you find you get a gap when you change from knit to purl try purling into the back of the first purl stitch binding off bind off in pattern knitting the knit stitches and purling the purl stitches and lifting over to bind off work the bind-off tightly to prevent the top edge from rolling or gaping you may need to go down a needle size for the bind-off \u00a9 ashcroft-hempsall 2013 - for personal non-commercial use only"
