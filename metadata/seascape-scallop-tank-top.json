  "notes": "the scallop tank top is summer in a top! the light cotton yarn combined with the breezy drape and scallop edging remind me of long beach days basking under the golden new zealand sun! the top is made entirely of single crochets, so it’s perfect for mindless crocheting while you listen to waves crashing on the beach, as a road trip project or while watching tv. the scallop stitch edge and tie straps add a feminine touch to the sleek silhouette, but there are options for plain straight straps and you can easily leave off the scallops for a simple v-neck tank top! \r\n\r\nsizes: xs(s, m, l, xl, 2xl, 3xl)\r\n\r\nskill level: easy\r\n\r\ncheck out more free crochet patterns **[here][1]**! \r\n\r\nsign up to my **[newsletter][2]** and never miss a new crochet pattern release!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://forthefrills.com\r\n  [2]: https://view.flodesk.com/pages/5ebf67c2ab499000265d1ad4\r\n"
