    "content": "the irish adventure bag was designed for our trip to ireland - and it s an exploration of cables and seamless construction the irish adventure bag features three different cable patterns each unique but there is still a rhythm to it bobbles frame the stitching throughout and the wrong side row offer a little break from the post-stitch action on the other side one of the things i m proudest of is the technique i used to make this bag seamless - even though it s all worked in row not in the round on top of that we only have to break the yarn once during crocheting with only 3 skeins used you could make this whole bag and only have 6-8 ends to weave in this pattern is free on the blog or you can purchase the ad-free pdf here"
