    "content": "this scarf features a completely reversible stitch pattern with a 4 row repeat and is easy to memorize i knitted this scarf in two pieces and seamed them together and i really believe that the seams prevent the scarf from getting stretched out the pattern is a fast knit- it took me less than a week from cast on to cast off ***i do not recommend this pattern for beginner knitters *** i get asked rather frequently where the yarn should be held when slipping a stitch hold the yarn in back also if you find that your stitch count is changing chances are you aren t passing the slipped stitch over if you are not familiar with this technique i recommend you google some videos on it it s very easy once you see how it s done ***about the yarn i used*** i often get asked what yarn i used the yarn is not available- my mother bought it for me from a church bazaar and the label on it is in german and says it was made in west germany which means it s probably from before the fall of the berlin wall it is an 80% merino 20% acrylic blend ******knitting in the round******* basically row 1 and 3 are just knit and purl row these would be the wrong side row when knitting flat but when knitting in the round it s pretty easy to just knit the knit stitches and purl the purl stitches- the completely reversible pattern ensures that it s consistent the intention was that your stitch count would be the same for both flat and knitting in the round since it is in the wet blocking that you ll get the full size measurements and it s meant to be as forgiving as possible of an inch here or there you may find that casting on 252 instead of 256 stitches avoids the double ribbing that would occur if knitting in the round exactly as written **if you are having trouble with modifying the pattern to work it in the round then i highly recommend swatching it flat as written first to get a feel for the stitches ** swedish pattern link is no logeravailable also available in french spanish and hungarian in the ravelry download files thanks to marjolaine 1 for the french translation 1 http //www ravelry com/people/elegnad"
