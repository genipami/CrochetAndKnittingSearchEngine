    "content": "i briefly soaked the scarf in cold water then gently squeezed out the water no wringing laid the scarf flat on a towel on the floor and blocked it to sharpen up the corners flatten any curling and straighten the crab stitch i found that this also softened the yarn a bit please follow the manufacturer s care instruc- tions for the yarn you use or just be safe and handwash the scarf in cold water as infre- quently as possible size customization this pattern is a simple construction that is easy to make wider thinner shorter or longer there are few things to know so you can make these adjustments to set the length start by chaining the desired length note that this chain will stretch i e lengthen a bit when you do the first single_crochet row so be sure to account for a little ease in your chain length and measure after you ve done the first single_crochet row to be sure you are at the desired length if not frog it rip out the stitches and do it again adjusting accordingly to set the width 1 the scarf is crocheted lengthwise so make sure you have the desired length set in the foundation chain because you will not be able to adjust it later by just stopping the pattern 2 the basic pattern uses four row of single_crochet on each side to frame row of single_crochet in front loop only the front loop only row create the subtle ribbing the first flo row is an odd num- bered row on the rs so i recommend doing odd number single_crochet flo row so you finish the rib on the rs but don t fret too much it s hard to tell rs from ws in this project so when you wear it no one will know whether the rs is up 3 the scarf is finished on all sides with a crab stitch which adds about another 1/4 on each side 1/2 total to width and 1/2 total to length so take that into account so the base width is 2 1/2 1 1/4 on each side for the 4 single_crochet row + crab stitch edge therefore once you have done the first four row do enough single_crochet flo row to bring you to within 1 1/4 of your desired width then switch and do the last 4 single_crochet row add the crab stitch edge and you should be close to your desired width finished objects i would love to see your fo e-mail me a picture at cathycrochets@hookedupcrochet com or if you post the fo online e-mail me a link enjoy copyright \u00a9 2010 by cathleen e corbitt-dipierro this pattern is for personal use only commercial or retail use is prohibited the pattern cannot be reproduced distributed or sold by anyone other than the pattern designer finished objects made with the pattern cannot be rev 9/7/10 sold when showing your finished objects please attribute the pattern"
