    "content": "many thanks to barbara walker s original creative idea of the large spider pattern thanks also go out to leslie of chewyknits for her help in getting this pattern together many years ago and for allowing me to add her large spider chart from the gardener to my pattern it is very sad that barabara and leslie are no longer with us but we can honor them by knitting their patterns added 3/7/21 - if you want to use leslie s spider chart instead of my written instructions it will represent the front of the leg on my sock her round 2 on the chart equals needle 1 of round 6 on my written pattern her chart will need to be flanked by 2 stitches on each side to match my written pattern for needle 1 p1 k1 her chart k1 p1 please also note the errata listed below for her chart and make changes to your printed copy i cannot correct the error on her chart for you sorry i am not going to create a new corrected chart i hope this answers your questions it has been a very long time since i wrote this pattern and i ask that you have patience in getting an answer- i have to reacquaint myself with it when there is a question 5/13/20 here you will find a lovely pair of fingerless gloves to knit the pattern is in russian but her charts are great and perhaps she has a better way of creating little spiders https //www ravelry com/patterns/library/mittens-spiders errata added 9/7/09 wollgeschnatter has brought it to my attention that there are a couple of little mistakes within the big spider chart included with my pattern -in the middle of row 17 there s a knit stitch missing before and after the m s -in row 19 there s a wrong sign compared to the written instruction there should be the sign for left twist purl bg instead of a simple left twist reading right to left row 19 of the spider chart should start with *purl 3 left twist purl bg* twice"
