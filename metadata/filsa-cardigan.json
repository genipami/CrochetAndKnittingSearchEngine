  "notes": "this is the cardigan version of the filsa sweater that i have previously released. the word ‘filsa’ means button in tunisian, and seemed like the perfect fit for this adorable little cardigan! the body is worked flat with a garter edge to create the button band. the simple lacework only uses two techniques, and can easily be left out of the pattern to suit a different style. the sleeves are knit using the magic loop method, with one round of rapid decreases before the i-cord bind-off.\r\n\r\nthere is a full youtube tutorial that i have created to show the cardigan knit step-by-step:\r\n[https://youtu.be/pbak8mey2eg][1]\r\n\r\nfinished measurements:\r\n\r\nchest circumference: 17 (18, 19, 20) inches / 43 (45.5, 48, 51) cm  \r\nyoke depth: 4 (4.5, 5, 5.5) inches / 10 (11.5, 12.5, 14) cm  \r\nsleeve length: 4.5 (6, 7.5, 8) inches / 11.5 (16, 19, 21) cm  \r\ntotal length: 8.25 (10, 11.5, 13) inches / 22 (25.5, 29, 33) cm\r\n\r\nyarn:\r\n\r\n2 (2, 3, 3) skeins of double sunday by sandnes garn \r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n 100g, (100g, 150g, 150g) of dk weight yarn that weighs apprx. 50g per 115 yards/ 105 meters. \r\n\r\nneedles:\r\n\r\n-24 or 32 inch / 80 cm us 6 (4mm) circular needles\r\n\r\nnotions:\r\n\r\ntapestry needle, 4 stitch markers, scrap yarn to hold sleeves, 4-8 buttons (approx. 1-1.5 cm)\r\n\r\ngauge:\r\n\r\n21 stitches and 28 rounds\r\n\r\nif you have any questions, please email me at kaaburaknits@gmail.com or send me a direct message on ravelry at kaaburaknits :)\r\n"
