  "notes": "a few directions in the pattern say \"twice\" instead of \"rep from * around\"\r\nyou will need to weave the tail of the head through the end and pull it closed. that part is missing from the instructions.\r\ndo watch the video included!\r\n\r\ni highly recommend a removable stitch marker and notes to make tick marks of the rounds as you complete them.\r\n\r\nyou will also need safety eyes or buttons.\r\n\r\ni made this dino with bulky yarn. details about adjusting for that in my notes on my project."
