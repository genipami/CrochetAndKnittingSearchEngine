  "notes": "while in chicago on a trip, i saw three different people wearing the same style hat.  i noticed the first one because i stare at anything knit, whether machine-made or handmade.  when i saw the second one, i assumed it must be a coincidence.  but after i saw the third one, i turned to my husband and exclaimed, “i must knit that hat!”  then when i went home for a visit and hung out with a hometown friend, she was wearing the same hat i saw in chicago, and i nearly tore it off her head in excitement.  i obsessively analyzed it, counting stitches and rounds so i could faithfully replicate it.  since then, i found out it's a popular slouchy beanie by cheveux corp (c.c).  the original hat has hundreds of positive reviews and appears to look good on anyone regardless of gender, age, face shape, and hairstyle (or lack thereof).  it is, in my opinion, the perfect unisex hat with the perfect amount of slouch!\r\n\r\nedit: due to multiple requests, this pattern has been updated with a note about converting this hat into a \"messy bun beanie\" - but keep in mind, this hat is meant to be slightly slouchie, and messy bun beanies are more form-fitting!\r\n\r\navailable now from iknits: a video tutorial to go along with the written pattern!  \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvp2zxbymgg&feature=youtu.be\r\n"
