  "notes": "i love having socks on my needles that are easy to pick up when i only have time to knit a few rows or to bring along with me!\r\n\r\nthese socks are knit using a super easy-to-remember pattern with gorgeous texture that is great for any type of fingering weight yarn - whether it be self-striping, tonal or speckled!\r\n\r\nthese socks are just as easy to knit as vanilla socks, but alot more fun and result in a better fitting sock too (in my opinion!)\r\n\r\n**the pattern is written with the texture pattern all around the sock on all 4 needles, but you can also choose to knit the pattern only on the front (needles 1 and 2)and knit the back (needles 3 and 4) in stockinette as i did in the picture shown.**\r\n\r\nas i was knitting these socks, the little block pattern reminded me of library books stacked on a shelf. and besides, what's more enjoyable than cozying up with a knitting project and your favourite book?\r\n\r\nthe pattern is written to be knit using dpns, but can modified to knit using magic loop or circular needles.  the pattern is for an adult medium sock, but can be easily be modified to knit a larger or smaller sock.\r\n\r\nso grab your needles, some yarn from your stash and get ready to cast on with me!",
