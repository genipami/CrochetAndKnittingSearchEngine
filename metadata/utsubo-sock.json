  "notes": "this pattern has been graded for seven sizes, and the instructions can be worked with any type of sock knitting needles: magic loop, 2 circular needles, or traditional or flexible dpns.\r\n\r\nthe story behind the creation of the utsubo sock patten:\r\nchiharu, the designer is a compassionate caregiver for the elderly, attentively listens to their thoughts, problems, and wishes.\r\nthrough her interactions, she discovered that many of them desired socks that weren't too tight around the cuff, but were still easy to put on and take off.\r\n\r\nthe utsubo socks are socks that provide a comfortable fit without tightness around the cuff, making them easy to put on and difficult to slip off. they were born from experiences witnessed in the caregiving field, designed to be gentle on swollen feet.\r\n\r\nmany people also knit these socks as gifts for those battling illness.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is available for free and they can be knit with just a small amount of yarn.\r\n\r\nthese socks are truly wonderful."
