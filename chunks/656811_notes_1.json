    "content": "this washcloth uses 2 yarns combined to create a thick variegated texture the rainbow yarn was quite thin so i combined it with some vintage cotton boucle that i ve had sitting around for a while just waiting for the right project combining the 2 yarns gives the washcloths an interesting texture and i ve used a corner to corner c2c crochet stitch which is perfect for showing off the colour changes in the yarn"
