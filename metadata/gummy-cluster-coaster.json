  "notes": "**this is a pay what you want pattern! use the code gummy50 for 50% off the original price or use the code gummy100 for a free copy. if you download for free, i’d love it if you gave this pattern a ❤️. thank you for your support! \r\n\r\nmeet the *gummy cluster coaster*—a fun, fast, and beginner-friendly project that’s bursting with texture and charm! this sweet little coaster features an interesting increase technique that involves crocheting around stitches, creating a beautifully textured surface while keeping the piece flat and practical. the pattern works up quickly, making it ideal for whipping up a cheerful set for your home or gifting to someone special. finished with a delicate picot border, the *gummy cluster coaster* brings a playful, handmade touch to any table.\r\n\r\nthis pattern uses dk weight yarn and a 4.5 mm hook. for coasters, i recommend a synthetic or plant-based fiber, as they tend to be more durable and easier to care for. this coaster is worked in the round using primarily double crochet stitches, with a unique increase technique that incorporates a variation of the front post stitch to add texture and visual interest. it’s finished with a delicate picot border that gives it a decorative touch.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is written for one size, which should comfortably fit most standard mugs. however, if you'd like to adjust the size, feel free to experiment with different hook sizes, yarn weights, or an extra round or two.\r\n\r\nthis is a beginner-friendly project that uses simple stitches and techniques. a photo tutorial is included at the end of the written instructions, along with links to video tutorials for all the special stitches to help guide you through the process.\r\n\r\nthank you for choosing my pattern, i hope you enjoyed it. if you enjoyed this pattern, you may be interested in some of my other patterns–you can check them out [here][1] :) you may sell as many of the finished items as you wish, but if you share on social media please give me credit @elly donner on ravelry and link the pattern to its source. if you have any questions or need pattern support, please contact me [here][2] @stopitharry on ravelry. i appreciate your support!\r\n\r\nthank you to my testers [fizzlllll](/people/fizzlllll), [divavonpurl](/people/divavonpurl), [jooleej](/people/jooleej), [maylina](/people/maylina), [lilabuczynski](/people/lilabuczynski), [tammywinkle](/people/tammywinkle), [signergirl1](/people/signergirl1), [jstockert](/people/jstockert), [czerwonykapturek](/people/czerwonykapturek), [melissayukon](/people/melissayukon), [katisha](/people/katisha),\r\nand [coffeebuddy](/people/coffeebuddy)! this pattern wouldn’t be possible without you <3\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.ravelry.com/designers/elly-donner\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/people/stopitharry"
