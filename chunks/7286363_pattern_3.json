    "content": "so for each foundation row you will be alternating between stage 1 and stage 2 until you have the required number of flowers for the row stage 3 happens on return row and this is where you finish off the flowers established in the most recent foundation row except for the flower on the left edge stage 4 is where you finish off any remaining flowers that lie along the left edge of the piece stage 5 is the final step where you will square things off with a filler round that is worked around all edges followed by a 3-round edging pattern 2-row stitches there are special stitches in this project that end up looking as if you ve stacked 1 double_crochet above the other making it appear as if you have worked 2 double_crochet row even though you have only actually worked 1 stitch in other words imagine you are doing a dtr but instead of doing 3 yo s before you insert the hook and draw up a loop you will replace the 2nd yo with a loop drawn up from the indicated pull-through from the previous stitch in the end this looks like you ve done 2 row of double_crochet instead of just 1 single dtr it s also very important that when drawing up the final loop that you go through the back loop of the indicated stitch this helps to keep all row looking the same keep in mind that there are variations including working into the same back loop more than once to make an increase on the bottom row as well as working 3 sts together on the top row to make a decrease please watch the video tutorial for a more comprehensive demonstration for these techniques 4 instructions unless otherwise stated all stitches are worked into the current floating ring special abbreviation - wfrs work first rounds round 1 a make sure the current loop on the hook or slip knot if working the very first flower is secured with a stitch marker b yo 10 times make a fr c yo insert hook into fr and draw up a loop yo pull through 4 loops on hook d being careful not to lose the loop that is nearest to the hook working loop remove all loops from the hook place the working loop back on the hook this creates a slack length of yarn between the current flower and previous one this slack yarn along with the marked loop remain on hold for now but will be used later to make the yo s required for the first stitch on the following rounds e yo insert hook into fr yo and draw up a loop twice yo and pull through all 5 loops on hook 5 times 6 stitches total for the round f if the fr has stretched out then pull on the slack yarn to tighten it g insert hook into next st draw through a loop before"
