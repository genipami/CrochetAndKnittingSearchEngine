    "content": "this is my go-to vanilla pattern when using self-striping or highly variegated yarns with a high instep usually a heel flap and gusset fits best but i don t like having the stripes disrupted in the instep area or large sections of pooling that can happen with highly variegated yarns so a short row heel is preferred for those yarns however i still need a gusset for my high instep hence these socks pattern can be worked either toe up or cuff down instructions included for both 6 sizes available easily adjustable i have discovered that if i use contrasting yarn leftovers or minis or whatever for heels toes and cuffs i can usually get two pairs of adult medium sized socks out of one skein all sizes have been tested"
