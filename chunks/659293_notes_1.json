    "content": "over the years i ve knitted many pants for the babies of friends and family roughly based on martina behm s \u201epepita pattern i knitted pants in two sizes for my little son during pregnancy but forgot to write down how exactly i did it so when another pair was needed i kept writing down every single step during the knitting process so that other knitters can use my notes for their own projects the pants are knit from the top down using shortrows to work the back a little higher than the front you can work eyelets to use an i-cord so that the pants stay in place which i recommend for older babies please be aware that i added a little knitted heart for my own sample you can read how i did this in my project notes this is not part of the pattern which is only a basic instruction for the pants"
