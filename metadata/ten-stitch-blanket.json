  "notes": "an elizabeth zimmermann inspired blanket worked in any yarn using only 10 stitches. you start in the centre and work in a sort of square spiral, joining as you go. no sewing up needed!\r\n\r\nall my ravelry patterns are free to download but, if you enjoy them,\r\nplease consider making a donation to the british liver trust where\r\nthe money will go to fund research and support the families of\r\nchildren with a liver disease. you can do this easily by going to my\r\nfundraising page [here][1]\r\n\r\nthis pattern has been translated into 12 other languages (so far), all the translations are available as free downloads by clicking on the 'download' link.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.justgiving.com/page/frankie-brown"
