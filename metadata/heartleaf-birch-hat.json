  "notes": "i designed this hat because i accidentally cast on the wrong number of stitches while trying to knit a different pattern and didn’t want to rip out all my ribbing. \r\n\r\nmaterials\r\nyarn: about 180-210 yds (165-210 m) of worsted weight yarn. i used malabrigo rios and washted. these are lighter worsted weights (210 yds/200 m per 100 g). if your yarn is heavier, you might run short of yarn. if you are worried about running out of yarn, you can opt for a single brim. \r\n\r\nneedles: size us 6 (4 mm) needles, or whatever size is needed to make gauge, 16-inch circulars, and double pointed needles (or your preferred method of medium- and small-circumference knitting in the round). \r\n\r\nsize us 4 (3.5 mm) needles, or 1-2 sizes smaller than your main needles, 16-inch circulars for knitting the brim ribbing. \r\n\r\ngauge\r\nabout 20 stitches and 27 rows in 4 inches by 4 inches (10 cm by 10 cm) of stockinette stitch, using the larger needles. \r\n\r\nsizing\r\nthis hat fits my 22-inch (56 cm) head. due to the stretch of the cables and ribbing stitch, i think it would fit about 20-24 inches (51-61 cm). to adjust the lenth, you could change the gauge, change the length the ribbing, or add or subtract a pattern repeat. my finished hat is about 11 inches deep, unfolded. i like long hats! many testers preferred to omit a repeat. \r\n\r\nthank you to all of my testers!\r\n\r\ncopyright: creative commons attribution - noncommercial-share alike 3.0 united states license. you should not sell this pattern, but other than that - do whatever you'd like! finished hats are yours to do with as you please. \r\n",
