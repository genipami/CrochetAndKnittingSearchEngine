    "content": "it s a cat toy designed to be the size and general shape of a mosue though this toy can be made with any yarn to make any size you like i suggest using a hook 1-2 sizes smaller than the yarn recommends i used a 3 5mm hook with worsted weight yarn this pattern is free it was made from scrap yarn so the yardage is very vague but i doubt it s over 10 yards if that"
