    "content": "celtic knot headband this pattern creates a stylish celtic knot headband but it can also be adapted for other projects such as leg warmers sweaters or decorative panels this pattern works well with almost any yarn and needle size the only time you may run into issues is when using super chunky yarn with very large needles materials yarn i used a blend of 30% wool and 70% acrylic yarn weight 3 knitting needles and a cable needle i used 4mm flat knitting needles scissors and a tapestry needle measuring tape gauge and size the celtic knot is an 8-row repeat and one repeat measuring 28 stitches per row comes out to approximately 10 5 cm in width and 5 cm in length my finished headband has 130 row in total including 2 setup row and 16 pattern repeats excluding the cast-on and bind-off with 28 stitches in each row the final measurements are 44 cm in circumference and 10 5 cm in width this pattern works well with almost any yarn and needle size the only time you may run into issues is when using super chunky yarn with very large needles to adjust the headband size you ll need to knit a small swatch and measure your head start by measuring the circumference of your head at the exact spot where you want the headband to sit use a measuring tape and it s easiest to do this in front of a mirror for the swatch cast on 28 stitches and knit one full 8-row repeat once finished wash and block the swatch then measure its width and height you can adjust the width of the headband by adding or removing stitches from the edges without changing the 16 stitches that form the celtic knot in the center to determine the length you need measure the height of your swatch then divide the circumference of your head by the height of one repeat for example if your head measures 55 cm and your swatch height is 3 cm then 55 \u00f7 3 = 18 3 if you want the celtic knot to continue seamlessly work the pattern 18 times giving you 54 cm in length if the continuity doesn t matter to you you can simply add a few more row in this example about 2 row keep in mind that the headband is stretchy so even if it s slightly shorter it will still fit comfortably also remember to include the cast-on and bind-off row as well as the 2 preparation row cast-on and bind off there are two ways to cast on and bind off both starting with 28 stitches unless you ve adjusted the edge stitches the first method is to use the long-tail cast-on and standard bind-off or any combination that creates a moderately stretchy edge once finished simply sew the ends together this will create a small seam where the edges meet in the pattern make sure to cast on and bind off"
