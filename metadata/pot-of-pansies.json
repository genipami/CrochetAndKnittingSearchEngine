  "notes": "an unashamedly floral afghan square, celebrating spring and summer pots and hanging baskets. you can really go to town with a riot of colours for a mixed pot of pansies or make all the flowers the same for more restrained elegance. the flowers are worked separately, then incorporated into the background. i really wanted to play with the idea of flowers that are not totally symmetrical. pansies have five overlapping petals, the bottom one is the largest, semi split and a kind of double petal. i have left it to you whether the actual flowers line up neatly around the bowl or are just thrown in giggling and jiggling.\r\n\r\nthere are a few different techniques used here, including cross double crochet, crab stitch, clusters and post stitches which result in a very three dimensional square. i have included plenty of pictures at the end of the pattern, so, although it is a fairly involved pattern, there should be plenty of help.\r\n\r\nthe square was designed for the 2025 crochet block-month group, and was tested by lynne, jilly, sandra and jacqui who also kindly contributed charts. many thanks. there will be a dedicated thread there should you need any extra help.\r\n\r\nthere should be plenty of scope to play with this pattern using different colours, orientation and degree of 3dness. \r\nthe original is made with dk and is just over 9”. worsted should give you an approximately 12” square.\r\n\r\nthere is also six inch “little sister” version [potty little pansy][1] which uses the same flower motif in a simpler square.\r\n\r\nhave fun!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/potty-little-pansy",
