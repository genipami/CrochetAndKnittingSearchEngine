  "notes": "this pattern is a great one to have in your library, because from the same basic design, you can work a great variety of things!\r\n\r\nyou can make a lovely long decorative garland in colours to suit the seasons, or work short lengths to make napkin rings. you can work in a thick woollen yarn to make a warm leafy scarf, or with fine cotton or cobweb yarn to make a necklace with an organic vibe. use a metallic yarn for a perfect christmas garland, or household string for an unusual washing line! there really are endless permutations!\r\n\r\nthe pattern is fully illustrated with colour photos, making it suitable for beginners branching out from the basics.\r\n\r\nmaterials & tools\r\n-----------------\r\nanything goes, depending on what you are aiming to create!\r\nnote that if you’re making a long garland, or something you are going to hang something else from, it’s best to choose a non stretchy yarn – cotton, linen, hemp, etc are perfect.\r\n\r\nin my example in the pictures above, i am using a lovely organic cotton double-knitting (dk, category 3, light worsted weight) yarn, and a 3.5mm hook.\r\n\r\ngage and size\r\n----------------\r\nnot critical in this project! just choose the hook that feels right for you with the yarn you are using, or for the look you want to create. \r\n\r\npatterns notes\r\n------------------------------\r\nthis pattern is available in both us and uk crochet terminology with standard crochet abbreviations.\r\n\r\npattern use\r\n----------------\r\nthis pattern remains the copyright of clare trowbridge and little conkers. you may not reproduce, distribute or sell all or any part of this pattern or its associated photographs. please do not sell items made from this pattern, without express permission (which is usually granted).\r\n"
