    "content": "these little woolly owls are gorgeous and easy to make the only problem with making them is that your children will steal them and hide them all around the garden the following is from bunny mummy s site i ve used double knitting worsted weight yarn it s my usual stylecraft but you can use any weight with the appropriate hook size gauge is not important the centre of your owl is made out of a modified sunburst granny circle super easy to do and one of my favourite crochet motifs also - the pattern is written in u s terms - this item is designed for decorative use and is not suitable for use as a toy for a small child"
