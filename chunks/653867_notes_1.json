    "content": "this simple boomerang shawl is my answer to the common question what can i make with hand-spun yarn its shape is halfway between a triangle and a crescent and it works with any yarn any gauge you simply cast on and continue knitting until it reaches the size you want or when you run out of yarn i recommend using a larger needle than your yarn calls for for a light airy fabric though this shawl can be made with any commercial yarn it is a particularly great way to highlight handspun yarn even beginner spinners with lumpy bumpy inconsistent yarn will be able to create a wearable garment using this pattern * the shawl pictured uses about 360 yards of worsted weight yarn and a size us 10 needle *"
