  "notes": "from designer:\r\n*ever since i posted my moss stitch shawl, i’ve been flooded with requests for a tutorial on how to use the moss stitch to make a square instead of a triangle. ask and you shall receive! using caron big cakes yarn in color jordan almonds, i figured out that you can easily make a moss stitch square blanket by crocheting in continuous rounds. i tried several times to do this using a join after each round but didn’t like the way you could see the seam. this is such a great relaxing project that you can do while binge watching your favorite shows or to take on-the-go while in waiting rooms or during kids extracurriculars.*\r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\n* 1 or 2 balls of caron big cakes yarn in color jordan almonds\r\n* size h crochet hook\r\n* tapestry needle"
