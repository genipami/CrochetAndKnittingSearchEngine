  "notes": "this is my pattern for a very simple but beautiful striped blanket which has oodles of surface texture and a lovely dense feel. despite the complex look of the stitch pattern, i promise you this is very easy crochet using two simple stitches to create a series of stacking shells. i would go so far as to say this is one of the easiest patterns i've ever come up with which makes it a perfect project for beginners embarking on their first blanket journey, or for those of us who really, really just love to zone out a little whilst working up some easy, rhythmic rows of colour.\r\n\r\npattern information\r\n\r\n♥ i have used the hydrangea yarn pack (15 x 100g balls of stylecraft special dk) worked on a 4 mm hook to make my hydrangea stripe blanket. the colours are as follows:\r\n\r\n♥ violet ♥ denim ♥ cypress ♥ mocha ♥ pale rose ♥ grape ♥ storm blue ♥ meadow ♥ vintage peach ♥ mushroom ♥ raspberry ♥ duck egg  ♥ pistachio ♥ camel ♥ parma violet ♥\r\n\r\n♥ these 15 balls are enough to make a single bed size blanket with a finished size of approx. 4ft x 6ft / 120 cm x 170 cm.\r\n\r\n♥ if you crochet loosely, you will need to make sure that your starting chain and first row measures roughly 120cm otherwise you will need more than 15 x 100g balls. it's fine to reduce your starting chain to achieve the correct size, just remember to make your starting chain a multiple of 4, plus an extra 2.\r\n\r\n♥ if you wish to make the blanket bigger ie to fit a double / king size bed, you will need to increase the number of stitches in your starting chain.....the starting chain should always be a multiple of  4, plus an extra 2. you will also need to purchase extra yarn if you make a bigger size."
