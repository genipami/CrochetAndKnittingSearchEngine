  "notes": "this easy stitch is perfect for an afghan or blanket. it is just sets of 3 stitches, one single crochet and two doubles. once you get into the hang of it, you can do it in your sleep! use it for a baby blanket in a pretty pink or blue or for a regular afghan with bright colors! you can change colors after a few rows for a multicolored effect. \t\r\n\r\nthe photo above is a baby blanket i am working on for charity. i am using a j-hook for this with worsted yarn. decide how wide you want your blanket to be and chain the proper number in multiples of 3. i chained 108 for this blanket and it is about 31 inches wide. for another blanket pattern using a similar stitch, click here. oh, and by the way, feel free to try this stitch on a scarf if you want! experiment!"
