    "content": "> this very simple cowl features horizontal welts by alternating stockinette and reverse stockinette stitch the laceweight silk mist yarn creates a weightless accessory with the appearance of great volume a piece like this is perfect for the transitional seasons of spring and fall and would be equally useful on cool summer nights i love how such a whisper thin fabric can be so effectively warm and cozy but what i like most of all is the ability to scrunch up a scarf like this and stuff it into a coat pocket to make it disappear when i m not wearing it my intention was a modern use for this laceweight silk/mohair blend jane richmond *this pattern is intended to use up every last inch of yarn if you ve made a particularly large swatch you may need to unravel it to achieve the full height of the cowl *"
