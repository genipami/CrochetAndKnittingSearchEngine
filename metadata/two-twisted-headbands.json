  "notes": "this pattern covers two different headband styles with a simple and stylish twist.\r\n\r\nthe first headband style is knit in double stockinette stitch, which yields a double-layer of stockinette stitch.\r\n\r\nthe resulting fabric is extra warm, and unlike regular stockinette stitch, it doesn’t curl!\r\n\r\nthe second headband style is a classic fisherman’s rib. this stitch is super stretchy and looks wonderful knit into a headband.\r\n\r\nthe accompanying tutorial video teaches you how to knit these two headbands from beginning to end. it includes tips like how to insert a lifeline (very essential!) and how to size the headband for a perfect fit.\r\n\r\nthese headbands are great last-minute gifts, so knit them up for the holidays!\r\n\r\nthe headbands pictured are knit with one ball of rico essentials merino dk in the color brick red (79) and on skein of swans island washable wool sport in the color edgecomb grey\r\n\r\n[click here for the free pattern & video tutorial][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://sheepandstitch.com/pattern/how-to-knit-a-twisted-headband-step-by-step-pattern/"
