  "notes": "updated for quince & co. chickadee organic heathers, october 2018! pattern now includes written instructions in addition to the charts. the original pattern is still available as a secondary file download if you prefer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nthanks to fellow raveler [tesha][1], this pattern is now available in norwegian! [the pdf can be downloaded from her blog][2].\r\n\r\nmany thanks for the translation, torunn!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\na fingerless mitt pattern showcasing a traveling twisted-stitch wave flanked by reverse stockinette and seed stitch.\r\n\r\ninstructions for the cable pattern are charted only.\r\n\r\nit is recommended to utilize the \"cable without a cable needle\" method for quicker results.\r\n\r\nplease note: 1 skein of heilo was enough to make the medium size; however there were only 2 meters of yarn left over. **as all knitters are unique, an extra skein is suggested** for peace of mind. if you do not end up needing it, make a second pair for a friend or loved one. :-)\r\n\r\nthe wave cable pattern is a modified version of a cable used for the am kamin sweater in the book “new style of heirloom knitting”, by toshiyuki shimada.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**march 25, 2010:** the pdf has finally been updated to include the correction below.  :)\r\n\r\nfeb. 24, 2009: at the beginning cuff, where it says to \"work twisted rib for 1.5 inches (make sure to start with a p st)\"—*this is for the smaller size only.* **for the large size, please start the ribbing with a k1tbl st.** thank you, labellementeuse!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/people/tesha\r\n  [2]: http://tesha.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/nalu-mitts-pa-norsk/"
