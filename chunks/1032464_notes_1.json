    "content": "in-and-out running vertical lines of double_crochet front post stitches look like climbing vines on this adorable little crochet blanket for baby other stitches include chain and double_crochet on this textured pattern that s made even more delightful thanks to the smoothness of bernat baby velvet yarn we ve used a neutral solid color to really bring out the design but any solid would be just as effective it s portably sized so take this blanket anywhere baby goes"
