  "notes": "in part 1 of this pattern, you’ll knit a pair of semi-traditional log cabin squares. no intarsia required! then in part 2, you’ll use a clever combination of joinery and miter techniques common to log cabin knitting to transform those squares into a unique pair of fingerless gloves with a neatly sculpted thumb gusset.  \r\n\r\nthey’re highly addictive and a great way to use up small amounts of yarn. the pattern is written for three colors in a particular arrangement, but you may distribute the colors as you like. in order for them to be a mirrored set, the two log cabin squares are worked differently from each other — one in traditional fashion and one not — both with strategic live stitches to be joined in part 2. \r\n\r\nsized for a hand about 7\"-8\" around, the pattern includes instructions for resizing them up or down, as well as other possible variations. it is highly adaptable and fun to play around with!\r\n\r\nshare on instagram with hashtags #mittalong and #logcabinmitts, as well as [#fringeandfriendslogalong][1], from which these first sprung.\r\n\r\nfor more details on the [fringe and friends log cabin make-along, see fringe association.][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/fringeandfriendslogalong/\r\n  [2]: https://fringeassociation.com/2018/01/05/logalong-highlights-timeline-and-prize-news/"
