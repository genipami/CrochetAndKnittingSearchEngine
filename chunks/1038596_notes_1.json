    "content": "a pretty and feminine triangular crochet shawl with on-trend 70 s flower motifs and lace lattice work the design works up surprisingly quickly using simple stitches over a 10-row repeat this shawl looks lovely worn teamed with a pretty feminine dress or worn over a plain jumper with jeans or long skirt this shawl can be made with yarn of any weight/ply and fiber however i recommend using a yarn that yields a soft and lacy drape for a lightweight shawl suitable for spring and summer use a 3-5 ply yarn a set gauge is not applicable to this item i recommend that you swatch with several hooks to determine which hook size will provide a soft and lacy drape with your chosen yarn the pattern includes a chart for the first two repeats and images for the more difficult row please note to work more than six full repeats with a 3ply yarn will require over 1000m five to six full repeats with a border will still provide for a generous sized shawl the diamond koi twirls deluxe example is six repeats plus 7 row i plan to finish the last repeat when i am able to source additional yarn until the end of june 2020 you can purchase the easy peasy posy shawl pattern and the easy peasy posy blanket pattern for the price of a single one of these patterns using coupon epp discount this pattern is also available for free on my blog minus chart images and repeats explanation enjoy"
