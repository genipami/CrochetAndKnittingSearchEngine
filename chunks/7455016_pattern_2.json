    "content": "other light dk weight yarn for this pattern but i highly recommend this lovely yarn for its softness colour palette and sheen you ll need minimal amounts of each colour so this pattern works great as a stash buster less than 40g 100m in total when complete your munchkin squash should measure about 7cm x 9cm depending on your chosen yarn and how tightly you crochet copyright \u00a9 2025 bilby & ben 4 instagram @bilbyandben the pattern and photographs of this design are the property of bilby & ben the pattern and design are subject to copyright and are for personal non-commercial use only you may not edit sell or distribute this pattern or use it as a base to pass off as your own design special stitches 1 front loop only flo usually a crochet stitch is worked through both loops image 1 working in the flo does not alter your st at all it just requires you to ignore that back loop and work only in the front loop instead of both likewise working through the blo would simply mean that you d be working in that back loop alone and not the front loop front back loop loop 2 x or cross stitch xs these patterns make use of the x or cross stitch instead of the regular single_crochet this is generally the preferred st for amigurumi because it image 1 results in a more plump and neat looking st to make it simply insert your hook into the stitch yu instead of yo as you normally would pull up a loop yo pull through 2 loops here s a handy video you might find helpful for comparison and to show you how it s done https //youtube com/shorts/h3npwfrsv9a si=og5p-imru0-9nd82 copyright \u00a9 2025 bilby & ben 5 instagram @bilbyandben the pattern and photographs of this design are the property of bilby & ben the pattern and design are subject to copyright and are for personal non-commercial use only you may not edit sell or distribute this pattern or use it as a base to pass off as your own design however if you re not confident using this st feel free to use a regular single crochet in its stead with only a little practice though i m sure you will find it just as natural to make this classic amigurumi st without even thinking about what you re doing 3 invisible decrease inv-decrease this technique gives your decreases a neater and less conspicuous look you can use a regular decrease if you d prefer but you won t find an inv-decrease much more complicated to make and the results are totally worth any effort required to learn it to make an inv-decrease 1 insert hook into flo of next st do not yo 2 insert hook into flo of 2nd st 3 yo pull up a loop 4 yo pull through all loops on hook copyright \u00a9 2025 bilby & ben 6 instagram @bilbyandben the pattern"
