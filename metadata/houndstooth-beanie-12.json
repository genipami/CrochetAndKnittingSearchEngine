  "notes": "the houndstooth beanie crochet pattern is a wonderful crochet beanie where it is all about the colour! the body of the hat is worked in a stitch pattern that, when worked by alternating between two colours, is called the houndstooth stitch (when worked in a solid colour, it's often referred to as the lemon peel stitch!).  the stitch pattern is quite easy to work as it is only single crochet and double crochet stitches.  you're going to love it!\r\n\r\na free written copy of this crochet pattern is found on my ad supported website: https://richtexturescrochet.com/houndstooth-beanie-crochet-pattern/\r\n\r\na free video tutorial for this pattern can be found on my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/richtexturescrochet/\r\n\r\nskill level: easy\r\n\r\ngauge: 16 sts x 16 rows of pattern = 4 inches\r\n\r\nfinished size:\t 8 x 10 inches laid flat, 20-23 inch circumference \r\n\r\nyarn: colour theory by lion brand® yarn (100% acrylic; 246 yds/225 m; 3.5oz/100 g; (4) medium/worsted weight): colour a: 1 ball of admiral; colour b: 1 ball of ivory.\r\n\r\nhook: size g/7 (4.5 mm) hook. adjust hook size if necessary to obtain correct gauge"
