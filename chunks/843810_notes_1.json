    "content": "the bamboo summer top is knitted bottom up and in the round until the armholes once you cast off stitches for the armholes and you divide for front and back you no longer knit in the round instead you knit front and back flat the piece starts at the bottom with 4 repeats of the open double wing stitch which has a multiple of 17 stitches i advise you to place a marker after each 17th stitch this will help you to keep on track after you are done with the lace part you continue in stockinette stitch alex creates 100% bamboo is a delight to work with please know that your bamboo piece will grow lengthwise after washing this growth has been calculated within this pattern ***please make sure to make a gauge swatch*** i strongly advise you to make a gauge swatch and wash your swatch the pattern states the gauge in the round you can make your swatch flat then wash it and lay it flat to dry if you get about 9 sts over 2 you will be fine your gauge will tighten up a bit as soon as you work in the round and i am sure you will then get 10 sts over 2 this pattern has been test knitted by 14 knitters we hope we got everything right but should you find an error please contact me immediately so that i can make it right thanks so much and hope you enjoy making this top"
