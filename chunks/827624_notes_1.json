    "content": "these cotton microwavable bowl cozies have become my favorite go-to project when i need something simple and fun to make they protect your hands from hot bowls of food whether it s fresh made soup or reheated leftovers from the microwave they re machine washable and very convenient i used less than 1 ball 95 yards each of four colors of peaches and creme yarn to make all four matching cozies pictured these fit all my my cereal bowls but it s probably best that you take one of your bowls and compare it to the cozy after round 4 to be sure it ll be big enough if it needs to be larger consider working up a hook size or adding an increasing row after row 4 if it s too short repeat row 13 to add height these minor adjustments won t have any effect on the pattern to use the cozy put it on the bowl before you fill it you can microwave it safely and never have to come in contact with the hot bowl they also help when you will be holding a hot bowl in your lap especially if serving someone in bed or elderly i use mine all the time feel free to contact me with any concerns or questions and you are welcome to sell the finished product i think they d make great additions to crochet gift baskets or housewarming gifts with kitchen supplies also good for using up cotton yarn scraps special stitches bobble stitch double_crochet worked in the round back loop only single_crochet"
