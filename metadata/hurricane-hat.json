  "notes": "this pattern was inspired by the colour of the yarn, but the simple nature of the pattern looks great in any colour.  the grey pearl colour really does look like swirling clouds.\r\n\r\nplease read the note below before pm'ing me - \r\n\r\nnote:  i am rarely on ravelry so if i don't respond it is because i had two babies in two years and one or both are driving me crazy  please feel free to use pattern for any charity knitting! \r\n\r\n*note*: the m1 after the ribbing section enables your knitting to move forward into a spiral as you work the pattern (without the m1 you will get a very widely ribbed hat-if that happens to you, it is probably because you've missed the m1)  \r\n\r\n*note*: now available in [hungarian][1] \r\n\r\n*note*: check out [undine's][2] version for something a little different (and bigger size!) her notes are awesome!\r\n\r\n*note*: i have changed pattern location.  please visit my \"new\" blog [love,hestia][3] \r\n\r\nthanks to zsuzska over at kötöttségeim - csak kötetlenül... for her translation :) \r\n\r\nhappy knitting everyone!\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://kotetlenek.blogspot.com/2011/04/hurrikan-sapka-forditas.html\r\n  [2]: http://www.ravelry.com/projects/undines/hurricane-hat\r\n  [3]: http://lovehestia.wordpress.com/"
