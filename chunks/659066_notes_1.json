    "content": "this lacy shawl isn t just a regular triangular shawl- it s worked on the bias this makes the triangle asymmetrical with one side longer than the other this shawl is really long and it is great to wrap several times around my neck i used one skein of knit picks stroll fingering in pacific tonal with size 6 circular needles it is worked flat but there does end up being quite a few stitches on the needles by the end this shawl ends up being 15 from the center point to the top and 107 from end to end along the top side"
