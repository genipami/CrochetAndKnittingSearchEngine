    "content": "get a fresh grip with your left hand and twist again with your right hand keep a slight gauge on the thread at all times repeat this procedure until you have twisted the thread the desired number of times 12 to 18 times normally does the job keeping a grip on the thread with the right hand reach up with the left and finish pulling the thread through your rope until it is almost all the way through be sure to keep the beads pushed up against the rope don t pull the thread up snug at this point leave just a little slack release the thread held by your right hand and watch them spiral into place if they don t seem to spiral back off your thread a tad once the beads have spiraled you can finish drawing the thread through not to tight though or you ll pull out your twist when you have your gauge adjusted draw thread through one more time to lock it in place move over one bead width and repeat by adjusting the gauge you should be able to get the same number of twists on each strand of fringe straight line fringe it is much easier to do this if piece is clamped to a solid surface to begin your fringe you want to thread a beading needle with about three feet of thread too much thread will cause you to fight tangles too little and you will be changing thread all the time draw thread through from front to back what ever you chose to do be consistent attach the thread in the corner of you work i draw threaded needle through the corner stitch and tie a knot thread all the beads you want for one strand of fringe on your thread in the order you so desire working from top to bottom so what ever goes up next to the purse is strung first run thread back up through the beads except for the very last bead you put on this will lock your beads onto the string if you desire the little clover looking end to your fringe then run the thread back up through your beads except for the last three beads you strung draw up snug to the piece not to tight or your strands will want to curl and not to loose or you will have a 5 gap of thread showing pass needle and thread through the piece at the same place as you started check your gauge and draw through once more this will lock your strand into place draw through in the next spot you want a strand of fringe move over about one bead width repeat process across the bottom of the piece work all thread ends into the piece clasps you can use any clasps that you so desire i like the s style as they are easy to put on by your self and are easy to use"
