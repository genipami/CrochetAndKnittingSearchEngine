  "notes": "**this knitting pattern has been rated pg-13 for stranded colorwork, thematic elements, and mild crude humor**\r\n\r\nnow showing: the film reel socks\r\n\r\nare you a movie buff? because i sure am. black-and-white or color, slapstick comedy or high fantasy, i love pretty much everything about movies. and there's nothing i love more than a good reference to something i've seen.\r\n\r\nthese socks are built to showcase your favorite movie- or show-themed yarn, no matter how variegated (and, in fact, the more variegated, the better!) so bust out those single skeins that you bought just for the name and give them a chance to shine. \r\n\r\nthis pattern is knit from the cuff down using stranded colorwork. there are 4 different heel \"genres\" for you to choose from:\r\n\r\n* thriller (cut-in afterthought)\r\n* sci-fi/fantasy (forethought)\r\n* action/adventure (german short row)\r\n* romcom (wrap-and-turn short row)\r\n\r\nchoose your own knitting adventure and knit the best fit for your fun single skeins. the possibilities are endless!\r\n\r\nlights, camera, action!\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nsizes\r\na (b, c, d, e, f)\r\napprox. finished circumferences of 7 (7.75, 8.5, 9.25, 10, 10.75)\" / 18 (19.5, 21.5, 23.5, 25.5, 27.5)cm\r\n*since these are colorwork socks, choose a size that gives you as close to 0\" of ease as possible, but not bigger than your feet (rather than the standard 10% negative ease for a stockinette sock)*\r\n\r\nyarn\r\nmc: retold yarns silver screen sock (463 yd/115g, 75% merino, 25% nylon) - 30-60g\r\nccw: any white or undyed sock yarn - 10-20g (i used the black squirrel yarns \"ecru brute\" on the wesley sock base)\r\nccb: any saturated black sock yarn - 20-40g (i used stunning string studio's \"little black dress\" on the stunning superwash base)\r\n\r\nneedles\r\nus1 (2.25mm) for non-colorwork sections\r\nus2 (2.75mm) for colorwork\r\n*i used 32\" circulars for magic loop on non-colorwork sections and 10\" circulars for colorwork, but use whatever sock knitting method you prefer.*\r\n\r\ngauge\r\nnote: the gauge for these socks is very important to ensure that the colorwork can fit over your heel.\r\n31sts x 40 rows **in colorwork pattern** over 4\"x4\"/10cm x 10cm, after blocking\r\n32sts x 48 rounds **in stockinette stitch** over 4\"x4\"/10cm x 10cm, after blocking\r\n\r\nnotions\r\n5 stitch markers\r\n2 locking stitch markers\r\nwaste yarn (for afterthought and forethought heels)\r\ntapestry needle",
