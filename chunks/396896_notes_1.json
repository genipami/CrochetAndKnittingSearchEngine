    "content": "i designed this easy pattern for a class i teach for new knitters this pattern goes beyond garter stitch teaching knit & purl recognizing the difference between these stitches using stitch markers counting stitches and row nothing too complicated but enough to keep a newer knitter challenged also good tv knitting for those more experienced you will need to know seed stitch which is used for the borders and sides any stitch dictionary or online search will give these instructions blanket is knit with seed stitch borders and stockinette blocks consisting of 10 stitches x 10 row then switching to the opposite if you just completed a block of knit stitches facing you in the first block now you will complete a block of purl stitches facing you the blocks of knit & purl will alternate across the row every 10 sts you can knit more blocks to make it both wider and longer if desired for newbies picking out yarn i kept it simple any # 4 yarn worsted weight no boucle or fuzzy yarns too difficult to see your stitches if you are a new knitter size 10 needles which will make it a looser gauge since most newer knitters tend to be tight simple finishing bind off sew in ends steam block lightly so the blocks lay a little flatter"
