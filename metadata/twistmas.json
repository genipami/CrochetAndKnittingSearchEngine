  "notes": "> espace tricot is a yarn store in\r\n> montreal, canada. discover our yarns\r\n> here!  [www.espacetricot.com][1]\r\n\r\ntwistmas is a fun and easy hat pattern featuring twisted rib throughout. the simple stitch pattern creates interesting texture while allowing your beautiful hand-dyed yarns to take center stage. it's knit with two strands of fingering weight yarn and one strand of a laceweight mohair blend - all held together. instructions for two versions of the hat are provided - the first one uses one colour for the whole hat while the second one invites you to use your scraps and mini-skeins to create your own \"faded\" version!\r\n"
