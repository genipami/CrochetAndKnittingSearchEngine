    "content": "these socks started as a simple pair of socks which would be a nice palette cleanser between my more complex ones but i didn t expect to love it so much they make perfect travel socks but also give you an opportunity to use all your scraps we start by making a contrastive rolled hem then we make a long ribbing ending with purl details in the same contrastive color as before main pattern is very easy to memorize it s just a 6 row repeat and it s very squishy if that s something you look for in a sock body of the sock ends with the same purl details and we make a ribbed toe matching the cuff ribbing there are both charts and written patterns for the main pattern and for the ribbed toe i ve also linked video tutorials for some parts of the pattern the socks are one size only but can be adapted notes in the pattern for a bigger or smaller size this pattern is more like a general guideline on making these socks so i don t recommend it if you haven t knitted a pair of socks before but don t hesitate to ask if you have some problems i ll be happy to help you can also tag me on instagram if you decide to share your finished socks i d love to see them i m @crochetedbybogusia and yes my main thing is crocheting don t be alarmed please note that this pattern has not been tested if you notice any errors please let me know and i ll fix them"
