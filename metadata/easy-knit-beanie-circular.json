  "notes": "easy knit pattern for a **fitted, slouchy or folded cuff beanie** hat. \r\nideal for beginners as a **first circular needle project** knitting in the round.\r\n\r\n**sizing & gauge**\r\n**8 sizes** now available from newborn **baby to xl** adult.\r\n\r\nwhile standard aran gauge of 18x24 is suggested, **exact gauge is not important** (especially vertical row gauge) as the hat is quite stretchy & you knit it to a certain length. the hat is your swatch, there’s no need for test squares. :smile: \r\n\r\n5mm is the pattern needle size as that's standard for aran yarn, but **i suggest using the needle size on the yarn ball band**. i used smaller 4.5mm needles to knit the lilac hat as that's the standard size for lion brand feels like butta.\r\n\r\n**yarn amounts**\r\nyou need 1 small 50g ball of yarn for baby sizes or 2 small balls/1 big ball to make a hat for a child or adult (with some leftover).
