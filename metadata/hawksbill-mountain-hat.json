  "notes": "here's a cozy, beginner-friendly hat pattern that's perfect for knitting gifts for loved ones. knit in the round with worsted weight yarn, this beanie features a 2x2 ribbed brim and an optional simple stitch pattern on the body. to keep things easy, it transitions to stockinette stitch before the crown shaping.\r\n\r\nthe stitch pattern includes both written-out and charted instructions and has been both tech edited and test knit. it's a great way to practice knitting in the round and chart reading!\r\n\r\none skein of worsted weight yarn will make the child, adult small/medium, or adult large size. you'll want 16\" (40 cm) circular needles and double-points in a size to get gauge, or you can use one long circular and the magic loop method. \r\n\r\nthis pattern has been test knit and professionally tech edited."
