  "notes": "by combining luxuriously-textured lion brand baby soft boucle yarn with your favorite shade of mandala or mandala baby, you’ll create an extremely soft, machine washable and visually-stunning baby blanket in no time.\r\n\r\nbecause the self-striping mandala does most of the color work and you don’t need to cut your yarn at the end of each row, you’ll be left with very few ends to weave in and a blanket that’s as soft as a baby’s…well, you know. choose from the many colors of mandala baby to make the blanket for a girl, a boy or keep it gender-neutral. \r\n\r\nthis pattern is quite easy and works up very quickly, making it great for last-minute baby shower gift or charity donation. skills necessary include double crochet and changing colors.\r\n\r\nthe printable, ad-free pdf includes a written pattern as well as several photos. the photos are separate from the written pattern so you may choose to print them or conserve ink.\r\n\r\n\r\nfind all my modern free crochet baby patterns [here][1]!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://makeanddocrew.com/category/knitting-and-crocheting/babies-children/"
