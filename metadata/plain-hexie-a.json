  "notes": "the 2024 vvcal will begin march 22nd, and run through august 2nd. it is a slow-paced cal with 20 weeks.\r\nlook for cal posts on (cypresstextiles . net) each friday during the cal.\r\nthe hexagon patterns are in us terms and uk terms, written, chart, and video instruction form, as well as step by step photos.\r\nevery friday during the cal, i will release new hexagon patterns and we will make them, and then join them and add a zero-waste border at the end!\r\n\r\nabout halfway through, while the vvcal is still running, i will release the entire cal condensed as a pdf for purchase."
