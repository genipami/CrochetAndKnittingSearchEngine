  "notes": "this is a little pattern i came up with for a soap saver! i got inspired after i found some wonderful handmade soap at a farmers market and i had no proper place to put it in my modern shower. it's quick to make, a perfect gift or market item and is so gosh darn practical! hope you like it :smile: "
