    "content": "**original idea credit** the idea for this hat came from the melt the ice hat by yarncultmn 1 i was unaware of the history of this hat before then unfortunately i don t knit and i was looking for a more historically accurate-looking hat to make and thus this crochet pattern was born **notes** the pattern uses single_crochet for a stiffer hat without holes that will be better for cooler weather for a floppier slightly more breathable hat try moss stitch single_crochet in every other stitch/skip a stitch using half_double_crochet will have a similar effect but the hat will be much longer while there is no video for this pattern the final page contains visuals and links to videos for each step/stitch you may or may not know 1 https //www ravelry com/patterns/library/melt-the-ice-hat"
