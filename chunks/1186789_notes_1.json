    "content": "years back i knit myself a fingering weight 1x1 ribbed double thick beanie the entire intention of it was to mimic as closely as possible those always cozy cheap basic beanies you can find at a gas station or carhartt store if you re feeling fancy knit from the top down and then decreased at the other end this hat is then folded inside itself for maximum warmth when you need it notes at the bottom though will tell you how to modify it if you only want a single layer note if opting to make the hat a single layer half the recommended yardage will be needed"
