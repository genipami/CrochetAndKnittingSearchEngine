  "notes": "**jomo socks**\r\nthere are lots of mojo socks on ravelry and this pattern is the perfect sock to get your knitting mojo back. i also wanted to call these the mojo socks because of two very special people in my life, my twin sister, jo, my best friend, and partner in twinset & purl and my lovely mum, whose name was mo but who is no longer with us. therefore, to make them a little bit different, these are the jomo socks!\r\n\r\nthis pattern will work for any fingering weight yarn but looks especially lovely in self striping sock yarn.\r\n\r\n**pattern information**\r\n**sizes:** 1 (adult m, 64 sts)/ 2 (adult l, 72 sts)\r\nto fit approximately 8-inch (20 cm)/9-inch (22.5 cm) foot circumference.\t\t\t\r\n**yarn:** the dotty wool co high twist sw merino sock (80% sw merino wool/20% nylon) 100g/365m (399yds) in the sunset colour way. \r\n**needles:** 2.5 mm / us 1.5 (or size needed to get gauge).\r\n**gauge:** 8 sts & 12 rounds = 1 inch / 2.5 cm in stocking stitch\r\n**notions:** stitch markers and cable needle",
