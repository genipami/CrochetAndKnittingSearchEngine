    "content": "my favourite crochet stitch at the moment is traditional corner to corner c2c stitch i have challenged myself to try different ways to use c2c rather than just blankets and this is my first soft toy pattern a fabulous frog the pattern does not cover the basic c2c technique but i do cover all the panel construction assembling and the sewing needed i use the c2c method of ch3 3dc this frog toy is constructed mostly from c2c panels in order to allow successful stuffing of the toy i have designed the panels to be used as coverings over an internal structural body and limbs the internal body section consists of 2 stretch fabric panels and 2 pieces of wadding that are hand stitched together and turned through the body is then partly filled with doll pellets and finished with polyester fill the limbs are formed from chenille sticks coated in wadding and then wrapped in stretch fabric panels this pattern would be great for using waste materials like old clothing that could form the internal panels and scrap yarn that could be used as fill i would love feedback on this pattern i can see lots of potential in it but would love ideas and guidance from other makers"
