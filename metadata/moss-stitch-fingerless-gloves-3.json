  "notes": "the moss stitch fingerless gloves feature, of course, moss stitch! these gloves use a slip stitch ribbing for a tighter, yet stretchy, fit around the wrists. sizes range from typical women's medium up to men's large - this equals measurements ranging from 7-9\" when measured around the knuckles of the four fingers. optional flaps finish it off! this pattern is free on my blog, or you may purchase an ad-free pdf copy here!\r\n\r\n"
