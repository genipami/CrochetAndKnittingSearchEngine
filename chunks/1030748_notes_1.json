    "content": "the **reusable produce bag** was created to provide an alternative to the single-use plastic bags common in supermarkets the convenience of the nylon bags is undeniable and the momentum of their usage is huge so we will have a hard time changing our ways but for many of us making small steps for decreasing the usage of plastics and making more environmentally friendly choices is the way to go many options for reusable bags are available for sale already but as a crocheter i love the idea of making them myself the bag is worked from the base up in the round using an easy mesh stitch the pattern is written and charted and includes three different sizes s/m/l based on the measurements of some commonly found reusable bags and drawstring produce pouches sizing is very easy to customize and adjust first several rounds while shaping the base require attention then it is a mindless and monotonous project"
