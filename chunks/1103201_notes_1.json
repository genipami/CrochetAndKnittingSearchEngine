    "content": "the general idea behind this design is that i wanted to achieve a very varied mix of colours but only use 4 yarns and mix them in a pixelated way to get an effect similar to old computer graphics or a cmyk colour profile the result reminded me a bit of an explosion in a confetti factory hence the name this is the perfect design for anyone new to stranded knitting - the colours simply alternate 1 by 1 and therefore there aren t really any floats to contend with make sure you have 4 really solid colours that all contrast well with each other to get the desired effect"
