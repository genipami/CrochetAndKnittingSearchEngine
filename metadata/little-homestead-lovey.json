  "notes": "this sweet and simple lovey is perfect for using up scraps and wrapping little hands in handmade comfort. crocheted in a soothing linen stitch and finished with a wooden or silicone teething ring, it’s the perfect blend of cozy and practical, ideal for gifting or making for your own little one.\r\nthis is a “make it your own” kind of project. adjust the size, change up the colors, and use whatever yarn you have on hand. depending on your chosen yarn weight and final size, you’ll need around 50–100 yards. sport to worsted weight yarns work beautifully. thinner yarns will require more yardage and produce a lighter, more delicate result, while thicker yarns will create a cushier feel.\r\nfor best results, choose a yarn that’s soft and baby-friendly; natural fibers like cotton, wool, or angora are especially lovely. they offer gentle texture for little hands and are soothing against the skin, with just the right amount of squish.\r\npair it with a natural teething ring and you’ve got a handmade treasure that’s as functional as it is adorable.\r\n\r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\nj (6.0 mm) crochet hook\r\n50–100 yards of sport to worsted weight yarn (more needed for lighter weights)\r\nwooden or silicone teething ring\r\nyarn needle for weaving in ends\r\nabbreviations (us crochet terms):\r\nch = chain\r\nsc = single crochet\r\nsl st = slip stitch\r\nsp = space\r\nmc = magic circle\r\n",
