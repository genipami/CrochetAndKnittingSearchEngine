things don‘t always go as planned, and too often, we become our own worst critics. we forget that yearlong (or longer!) commitments are hard. we fail to extend grace to ourselves in the same way we might extend it to others. let‘s try to break that bad habit together as we stitch through this project. the goal of this knit-along is to bring you joy. it's an opportunity to learn new stitch combinations, to play with color, and to create something special, knowing that other knitters around the world are right beside you, cheering you on. if you don‘t finish, that‘s okay! if you do finish, congratulations!\r\n\r\none of my favorite aspects of knit-alongs is the camaraderie they engender. we celebrate when things go right; we commiserate when things go wrong; we remind each other that no matter how things go, we are in this together. we demonstrate kindness to one another—the same kindness each of us should give ourselves. \r\n\r\n* click [here][12] to watch a video about this month's clue.\r\n* the sample shawl used approximately 1207 m / 1320 yds in total: color a) 46 m / 50 yds, color b) 55 m / 60 yds, color c) 110 m / 120 yds, color d) 105 m / 115 yds, color e) 124 m / 135 yds, color f) 119 m / 130 yds, color g) 101 m / 110 yds, color h) 110 m / 120 yds, color i) 91 m / 100 yds, color j) 105 m / 115 yds, color k) 101 m / 110 yds, and color l) 142 m / 155 yds. \r\n* **it is important that you save all of your leftover yarn until the end.**\r\n* gauge isn't crucial but can affect overall dimensions and yarn amounts.\r\n\r\n*designed by janica york carter*\r\n\r\nyou'll receive a digital file only (instantly downloadable as a pdf) and won't be shipped anything. please allow a few minutes for the download link to be emailed to you. if the email doesn't arrive within a few minutes, just log into your account on our site, and you'll see your completed orders. from there, you'll find the download link.\r\n\r\nenjoy your knitting!\r\n\r\nchandi\r\n\r\nnew?
