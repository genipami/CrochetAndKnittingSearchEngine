    "content": "so that s usually 8-12 sts so let s say i want it to be 3 that s 12 sts for the front of the crotch and 12 for the back - 24 sts total so i subtract 24 sts from the total amount of stitches of the body say the body has 72 sts that would be 48 if i divide that in half that s 24 sts i need 24 sts on either side of the crotch for the crotch to be directly in the middle so i use stitch markers and try to guess where i think the middle 12 sts for each side should go then i count the stitches on either side to make sure that s correct i usually am but sometimes need to move the stitch markers over a few stitches to make sure so i join w/ a single_crochet where i m starting the crotch in the front and single_crochet evenly across then i chain 1 turn and single_crochet decrease single_crochet across to the last 2 single_crochet and single_crochet decrease again chain 1 turn work one row even single_crochet then do another decrease row repeat this until the crotch is about 1/2 -1 wide i usually like the flap to be about 1 1/2 long or so then i finish off and do the back flap the same way but instead of finishing off that flap turn your work inside out and slip_stitch the flaps together then you ll turn your work right side out again pick up your original yarn from the body and start the legs crocheting into the sides of the crotch row remember to shorten the length of the body of the pants because the crotch will add to the rise if you need any help with this please email me at patti@dandeliondreamers com and i would be happy to walk you through it or explain it to you in a different way copyright \u00a9 2004 by patti gonsalves all rights reserved this pattern is for the personal use of the buyer only no part of this pattern may be reproduced adapted translated stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any form or by any means electronic mechanical photocopying recording or otherwise without the prior written permission of patti gonsalves persons interested in a commercial license may contact patti gonsalves at dandelions2@yahoo com or http \\\\www dandeliondreamers com for further information page 5 of 5"
