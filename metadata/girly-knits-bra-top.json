  "notes": "if you would like a .pdf download of this pattern, the option to knit it on straight needles, in the round, or on a knitting machine, as well as instructions for adapting this bra top for any yarn/gauge/needles/bust measurements, check out my new pattern \"get it girl\" which also has an updated back making the straps easier to attach!  you can find it [here][1], and of course still find this pattern for free below.\r\n\r\nsuper cute and cozy, fashion forward, and a great layering piece, knitted bra tops are all the rage!  you've seen them at free people and urban outfitters, and now it's time to knit your own!  \r\n\r\nwhat is a bra top you may wonder?  it's half bralette, half tank top - you can either lounge around in it worn as a bralette (if you don't require a lot of support) or it can be worn out and about over a bra as a cropped tank top.  however you decided to rock it, you will love it!\r\n\r\nthis design uses worsted weight yarn and is knit in the round as one piece, so it will knit up quickly with minimal finishing. this pattern is quite simple and straight forward as well, so if you want to add a stitch pattern, do a different type of ribbing, do something fun with the straps, etc., i encourage you to do so and make this bra top uniquely your own!  \r\n\r\nplease share photos of your finished projects here on ravelry, and if you want to ask questions or connect with other knitters knitting the pattern, join the knit-a-long [here][2]!\r\n\r\nthe pattern is free on my blog, where i've also posted a video walking you through each step of the pattern.  enjoy! :)\r\n\r\nhttp://knittingisawesome.com/howtoknitabratop/\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/get-it-girl-bra-top\r\n  [2]: http://www.ravelry.com/discuss/girly-knits-fan-club/3129604/1-25"
