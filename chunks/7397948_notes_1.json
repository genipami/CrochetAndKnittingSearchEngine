    "content": "i designed this hat for a friend of mine who keeps bees and jars her own honey she loved it so i decided to write it up and share it with other ravellers please believe me that the double ribbed brim is worth the effort and increases the coziness and comfort of the hat the cable pattern for the honeycomb should be straightforward and creates a lovely pattern in the crown decrease i hope you enjoy making this hat whether you are also a beekeeper or not or are just someone who appreciates our precious insect pollinators that are so important both for the food we eat and the flowers we cherish for their beauty ------------------ all efforts were made to make this pattern error-free it is intended for individual home use only not to be reproduced or reknit for profit"
