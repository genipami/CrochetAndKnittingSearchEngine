  "notes": "the floor turtle lives, as you might guess, on the floor of your kitchen.  he’s not a towel, he’s not a dishrag, he’s just a little friend who likes to mop up drips.  as his main function is to roll around on the floor and get dirty, the yarn you choose should be absorbent and durable, like cotton.  the sample was knit with knit picks dishie and some scraps of cascade anchor bay but you may use any scrap yarn you have that brings you joy.\r\n\r\ngauge: 18 stitches and 26 rows over 4 inches\r\n\r\nthe sample is knit in worsted weight cotton on size 7 needles. as there is nothing to fit, the gauge is a mere suggestion to reach a similar size to the sample. any worsted weight yarn or yarns held together to reach worsted weight, should work.  you will need approximately 50 yards of yarn, inclusive of  legs and head.\r\n\r\nthe floor turtle is worked in the round from tail to neck.\r\n\r\ninstructions are written with magic loop in mind but you may use any small circumference knitting style of your choice.\r\n\r\nfeet and head are picked up straight through the turtle shell and worked in garter stitch.  these parts are decorative.",
