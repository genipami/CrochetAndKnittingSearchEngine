  "notes": "this hat was created for my boyfriend to keep him warm on those chilly early mornings heading to the bakery. the fold-up brim is knit in 1x1 ribbing with a singular knit row to make a tidy fold, and it's finished with a beautiful square decrease. i used berroco ultra alpaca in 'tiger's eye mix' and 'moonshadow'.\r\n\r\nif you love this pattern and want to support more free designs like this one, consider donating a cup of coffee! \r\nhttps://ko-fi.com/madebyemknits\r\n\r\nthank you!\r\n\r\nyou're welcome to sell hats made using my pattern:\r\n\r\nif you’re selling online, credit me as the designer and provide a link back to the pattern listing.\r\n\r\nif you’re selling in person, credit me as the designer on the item’s tag.",
