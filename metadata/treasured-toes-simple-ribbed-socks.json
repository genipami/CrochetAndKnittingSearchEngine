  "notes": "this is my favorite go to sock pattern for 99% of the socks i knit! i've been asked to share my details.\r\n\r\nthis is a top down sock, starting from the cuff. i've included info on how to use mini skeins or little bits of contrasting yarn for cuff edge and toes but you can always knit this out of one skein of yarn without the extras.\r\n\r\nthe stretchy 1x3 ribbing makes this a sock that stretches out and in very easily so it fits feet so great! no worrying about a perfect fit. it's also super easy to remember so you don't need to pay strict attention until it's time for turning the heel or knitting the toe. perfect for watching your favorite shows while knitting!\r\n\r\nsock yarn used: treasured toes sock yarn in pieces of eight (silver gray) and about 48 yards of treasured toes sock yarn in feelin' fine with blackberry wine (rich burgundy red).",
