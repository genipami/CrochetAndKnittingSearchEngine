  "notes": "mutabilis is a simple tube in (crochet) linen stitch; can be used as cowl, hat, headband, balaclava, hood, or gaiter. \r\n\r\nmutabilis is completely reversible, and can be made in different yarns, from laceweight to aran. the pattern is written for 1 skein of fingering weight yarn, but the size can be changed by the number of stitches, size of the hook, and the weight of the yarn. \r\n\r\nthis is a versatile pattern that can be worn in a wide variety of styles; can be made in a variety of yarns; and can be adapted to a wide variety of sizes.\r\n\r\nlinen stitch in crochet is an easy and elastic stitch pattern, lies flat, and helps to 'pixelate' and tame the colors of those wonderful, precious skeins of yarn that look so fabulous as yarn, but tend to look less satisfying when worked.
