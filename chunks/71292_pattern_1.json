    "content": "brown sugar shrug - rough pattern / tutorial i used lily s sugar and cream cotton yarn in caramel from the confectionery colours line and a k hook the directions should work equally well for any yarn/hook combination to start you need three measurements you can take these directly from the person who will be wearing the shrug or from a decent-fitting jacket or top neckline not the actual neck but the shrug neckline the length around where the person wants the shrug to sit shoulder length from the neckline to the end of the shoulder/start of the sleeve arm circumference you want this at the point with the largest circumference and make sure to include some ease so this can be worn over clothing a note on gauge and swatching in a pattern term used very loosely like there is no gauge to match but you still need to make a gauge swatch using your selected yarn and hook measure your swatch wash and block it let it dry then measure again use the percentage increase if any to adjust the measurements you took above so if you made a swatch 20cm by 20cm if your swatch grew from 20cm wide to 22 cm wide the width is measured along the row or by 10% after blocking and your original neckline measurement was 40cm your new neckline measurement would be 40 cm divided by 1 1 = about 36 5 cm note these numbers are completely made up and don t match any actual neck or swatch that i know of adjust the arm circumference by the same percentage if your swatch grew from 20 cm to 21 cm in hight height is measured across the row then you need to adjust the shoulder measure by 5% or by dividing by 1 05 ok got that using your new adjusted measurements make a chain the length of the neckline the chain should be a multiple of 6 stitches + 4 you can fudge this a little if needed the body is divided into 5 parts left front left sleeve back right sleeve right front with one extra stitch between each two parts to figure out where your increases go subtract 4 from the number of stitches in your starting chain and divide this number by 6 the resulting number is your shrug unit if you had 70 stitches in the starting chain the shrug unit is 70 - 4 /6 = 11 the fronts and sleeves are each one shrug unit this would make 11 stitches in each front and sleeve the back is two shrug units wide and would have 22 stitches put a marker in the extra stitch between each section or you can just count time to start crocheting into the chain chain 3 counts as first double_crochet double_crochet into the fifth chain from the hook double_crochet into each chain until you reach the first marker in the marked stitch do an increase of 1 double_crochet"
