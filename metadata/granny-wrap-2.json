  "notes": "i wanted to make something incredibly simple that would show off the gorgeous colours of this yarn and be quick and easy to make (my favourite sort of project) \r\nand so a half-granny design seemed perfect.\r\n\r\nyou can use any yarn you please to make yours; simply alter the number of rows you complete to change the size."
