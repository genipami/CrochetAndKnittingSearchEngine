    "content": "divide the total row number by six to give the number of row to knit for the bottom m strip add one more row for the top strip knit four times as many row for the c section as you did for the bottom m strip that all sounds a bit confusing i know so i ve given a few examples in the table on the next page which tells you how many row to knit for each section with three different numbers of stitches following these guidelines will give you squares with coloured oblongs inside them stitches total row bottom m c top m 18 36 6 24 7 24 48 8 32 9 36 72 12 48 13 so back to the pattern \u2026 knit 49 squares 24 with one shade of c and 25 with the other my two shades were quite similar but only the rainbow had blue in it sewing the squares together arrange your squares in seven row of seven turning every other square on its side i alternated my two colourways starting and finishing with the one that i used for the extra 25th square using the cream yarn sew the squares into row and then sew the row together work into the yarn behind the cast on and cast off stitches and into the bumps at the end of the ridges on the sides this will not be an equal match try missing one side stitch at the start and end of each c section when it comes to joining the row it is easy to get confused about where the squares start and finish so i found it helpful to pin the ends of the squares together x x marks the spot where the optical illusion only starts to become the four squares meet evident as the row are sewn together take your time over this stage work slowly and don t pull your seams too tight the edges will all look a bit wavy at this point but a combination of a knitted border and some blocking will straighten them out then borders these are knitted on to the blanket one side at a time you will need one or two long circular needles in the same size as you used for your squares the borders are knitted back and forth but you need long needles to hold all those stitches i used one 100 cm needle using the two ends as separate needles with the right side of the blanket facing pick up and knit 30 stitches per square all along one side this gave me 210 stitches place pins to mark out the inches across each square you will be picking up six stitches per inch knit 10 row slipping the first stitch of each row knitwise after the first row cast off knitwise using a slightly smaller needle to stop the edge flaring i used a 3 mm straight needle for this now work the border on"
