    "content": "last summer i designed a simple beginner bralette-style crochet top with the aim of creating a fun basic piece that could be altered easily the basic bralette since then it s been on my list to create some modified versions especially one that is better for curvier busts the flattish triangle style cups are great because they can be expanded to any size but to fit best over bigger chests they need some edging to curve them inward a little which i did with this version of the pattern as with the first tutorial the gauge and size is customizable so you can build a bralette to fit you the way you want hope you enjoy"
