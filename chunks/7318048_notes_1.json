    "content": "# tidepool crochet beanie hat i m super excited to share this crochet pattern for a worsted weight ribbed beanie hat with a subtle wave design you can download a condensed pdf version of the pattern from ravelry to print but the full detailed pattern with more photos is at https //www margaretmakesthings com/blog/tidepool-beanie-crochet-pattern solid tonal and variegated yarns all look great in this pattern though the wavy design will be most highlighted with a solid color the effect is reminiscent of faux cable brioche knitting it conveniently uses just under 100 g of the suggested yarn malabrigo rios so it can work as a one-skein project ## sizing the hat in this pattern is for one size that should fit adults with a 21 to 23 head circumference and is meant to fit with negative ease the final hat measures 10 across at the base when laid flat i e 20 brim circumference and 11 5 long when seamed length is determined by the foundation chain and row gauge determines the width ## pattern overview * this pattern is written in us crochet terms and uses standard cyc abbrevations * gauge is 12 row in pattern = 4 and 17 stitches in pattern = 4 for worsted weight yarn with a suggested 5 0 mm crochet hook if you are a smidge under 4 for row gauge that should be fine as the fabric is stretchy * tight crocheters may want to size up to a 5 5 mm hook row gauge is more important than stitch gauge for this pattern pick a yarn and hook combo that gives you the row gauge and adjust the stitch counts so that the hat remains a length of 11 5 -12 if you make it longer than that you ll probably need a second skein * **stitches used** chain single_crochet half-double_crochet double_crochet yarn over slip_stitch working in back loops only this pattern does not include tutorials for basic stitches chain single_crochet half_double_crochet double_crochet or working into back loops but includes instructions for yarn over slip_stitch * **construction** the hat is worked in a single piece with the row running vertically so it grows width-wise as it works up the crown is shaped using short row * **finishing** the fabric is joined into a tube with with a seam of single_crochet there is an additional ~2 of hand sewing mattress stitch suggested to close the hole at the top with the suggested construction you will need to weave in 4 ends"
