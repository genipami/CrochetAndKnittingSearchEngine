    "content": "this is a sweet little project that uses a small amount of fine cotton yarn to make a daisy chain necklace or bracelet of your desired length the pattern is very simple consisting of only chains and slip stitches some crochet experience does help though the pattern is my original design and i haven t seen any patterns or images online that look like it however due to its simplicity it s possible there are other versions out there so any similarity is entirely coincidental"
