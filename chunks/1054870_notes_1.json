    "content": "is there anything cuter than a baby in a baby bear hat i love how adorable these hats are especially considering how quick they are to make this is an easy project so will be perfect for a beginner the pattern can be used to make a basic beanie aswell but the bear ears really make the hat for me so i add them on as many things as possible to make your own baby bear hat you will need a 6mm crochet hook double knit yarn a tape measure a pair of scissors and a yarn needle this pattern is for a hat to fit a newborn with a head circumference of up to 14 5\u2033 at the end of round 3 the hat should measure approximately 4\u2033 in diameter please bear in mind that i crochet quite tightly so you may need to go down a hook size to get the right diameter use whichever hook you need to get the correct hat size"
