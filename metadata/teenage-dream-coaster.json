  "notes": "**this is a pay what you want pattern! use the code teenagedream50 for 50% off the original price or use the code teenagedream100 for a free copy. if you download for free, i’d love it if you gave this pattern a ❤️. thank you for your support!\r\n\r\nintroducing the teenage dream coaster – a bold and modern crochet design that’s both functional and stylish! this coaster features a textured, eye-catching base paired with a playful bobble edging and a ribbed border for extra depth and interest. with its quick and easy construction, it’s the perfect project for beginners or anyone looking for a fast, satisfying make. whether you’re crafting for yourself or creating gifts for loved ones, the teenage dream coaster brings a unique flair to any space with minimal effort. get ready to add a pop of texture and personality to your home!\r\n\r\nthis pattern is made in worsted weight yarn with a 4.5mm hook. i think a synthetic or plant fiber is best for a coaster, as you will want it to be easy care. this coaster is worked in the round featuring the single and double crochet stitch. work increases every round incorporating textured elements by working into rounds below your current round. you end with a decorative bobble edging with a ribbed border. gauge is not crucial in such a small piece.\r\n\r\nthis pattern is written for one size which should be a perfect fit for most mugs. if you find that it is too small/too large for your mug, i encourage you to experiment with another gauge or the number of rounds.\r\n\r\nthis is a beginner friendly pattern, it uses basic stitches and includes a photo tutorial at the end of the written instructions. there are also links to video tutorials for all the special techniques.\r\n\r\nthank you for choosing my pattern. i hope you enjoyed it. you may sell as many of the finished items as you wish, but if you share on social media please give me credit @stopitharry on ravelry and link the pattern to its source. if you have any questions or need pattern support, please contact me @stopitharry on ravelry. i appreciate your support!\r\n\r\nthank you to my amazing testers [signergirl1](/people/signergirl1), [jooleej](/people/jooleej), [dawnlambert88](/people/dawnlambert88), [maylina](/people/maylina), [tammywinkle](/people/tammywinkle), [jstockert](/people/jstockert), and [czerwonykapturek](/people/czerwonykapturek)! this pattern wouldn’t be possible without you :) \r\n"
