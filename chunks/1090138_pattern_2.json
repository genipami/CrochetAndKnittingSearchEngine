    "content": "gusset i use the left-hand needle to pick up front to back the bar between the stitches and then knit that through the back i m pretty sure you can use any method you prefer however i knit these mitts on magic loop because -- quite frankly -- i see no reason to ever knit any other way you can also easily do two mitts at a time using this method once you have knit a pair of these and if you are as fussy as i am you can adjust subsequent pairs as you see fit too long for your liking maybe decrease the final rounds of stockinette to 14 and/or decrease the ribbing to 6 top of the cuff lands a smidge too far above your wrist bone do an extra round or two of stockinette after the cuff and before starting the thumb gusset increases but wait there s more do you want a narrower thumb hole for a smaller hand increase the thumb gusset to only 19 stitches instead of 21 and then bind off 18 if you do this you may want to add a round or two to the final stockinette section so as to keep the same finished length or do you require more negative ease in the top ribbing as suggested in the instructions above decrease 4 stitches as you knit the first row of ribbing at the top incidentally this pattern provides a great way to use up leftover sock yarn if you don t have enough for an entire pair my sample pair weighs 33 grams maybe use one color for the ribbing and another for the stockinette section i get excited just thinking about this possibility actually is that weird that excitement i m thinking it might be weird credits to create these mitts i have incorporated aspects of other patterns that i like i admire the way jeanne stevenson binds off the thumb holes for her 75 yard malabrigo fingerless mitts so i incorporated that i also have always loved weezalana s mitt envy pattern and i have used her method for increasing for the thumb gusset here also a tip of the hat to all my irl knitting friends who always help me solve small knitting problems with ease"
