  "notes": "stay extra warm and cozy on any adventures you have this fall and winter, with the wanderlust scarf! so many of you mentioned that you loved the [wanderlust beanie][1], and how simple it was to make, that i had to design a scarf to go with it. there is now a [matching pair of mittens][2].\r\n\r\n**this pattern is available for free on my website, (visit pattern website link above), or you can download it here on ravelry as a printable, ad-free pdf** \r\n\r\nthere are some differences in the way this scarf is worked (rows), compared to the hat which is worked in the round, but i have also included an infinity scarf/cowl version that is worked very similarly to the hat, and won't have any \"wrong side\" rows facing the front, as the  regular scarf does (should that kind of thing bug you). this yarn hides most of that though, as you can see in my preview pictures, but some of you might be perfectionists (like me), and so i wanted to disclose that up front. :)\r\n\r\n**difficulty:**\r\neasy\r\n\r\n**materials needed:**\r\n5.5mm  (i) hook\r\n350-375 yards lion brand yarn heartland in \"joshua tree\"\r\nyarn needle\r\nscissors\r\n\r\n**stitches used:**\r\nch = chain\r\nsc = single crochet\r\nhdc = half double crochet\r\ndc = double crochet\r\nfpdc = front post double crochet\r\nbpdc = back post double crochet\r\n\r\n**gauge:**\r\n13 dc stitches in 4\"\r\n\r\n**measurements:**\r\nabout 6 ft, (7 ft, 8 ft) long, by 6\" wide\r\n\r\n**additional notes:**\r\nif you would like to make a cowl, or infinity scarf instead, i've included those instructions below the regular scarf instructions. you will be working in a circle, so things will be slightly different, and constructed more like the matching wanderlust beanie.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/wanderlust-beanie\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/wanderlust-mittens"
