  "notes": "the linen stitch is one of the simplest stitch patterns to master and yields a pretty, woven, dense fabric. the reason it is so simple is that you don't even have to know how to work into the loops of the single crochet stitches, because you will be working into the ch-1 spaces between single crochet stitches instead.\r\n\r\nthis pattern starts off with a photo tutorial on how to make the linen stitch, followed by a pattern for a linen stitch dishcloth.  the pattern can also be used to make a lovie for a special baby (i used it in my [circus elephant lovie][1]).\r\n\r\ni suggest using cotton if you are going to make dishcloths, or any soft yarn if you are going to make a lovie.\r\n\r\nenjoy,\r\n\r\ndedri\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/edward-circus-elephant-lovie-cal"
