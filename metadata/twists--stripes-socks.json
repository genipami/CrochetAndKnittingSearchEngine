  "notes": "this is my go-to sock when i want to knit a sock that’s quick and intuitive, yet still looks well-crafted and fits my foot perfectly. the cables are worked without a cable needle and lengths are measured in number of repeats, making it an easy project to take along wherever you go.\r\n\r\nthe twists & stripes socks is a simpel and well-fitted design constructed of twisted rib and cables. it is knitted from the cuff down using flexible sock needles like the crasy trios or one long circular needle for magic loop. the heel construction includes a traditional heel flap and gusset technique which allows for a wonderfully fitting sock.\r\n\r\ninstructions is provided as both written instructions and charts.\r\n\r\nany fingering weight sock yarn will work. the sample is knitted in fru fjellmans bamboo sock in the colorway ocean.\r\n\r\nerrata: corrected a chart error hours after publication, please download the pdf again!"
