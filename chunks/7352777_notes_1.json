    "content": "the water balloon this is a super quick easy crochet pattern by using a chenille yarn you get water balloons that are crazy absorbent and squishy these are so easy to use you just dunk them in a bucket of water let the super absorbent yarn soak it up like a sponge and fire away the other great thing about using this yarn is they are reusable washable and dryer safe i have used these with my teenage boys and we find that they do not hurt we use the rule only throw below the shoulders no head shots make sure they are free of debris before use these are to be made and used at your own risk"
