    "content": "tail-ender designed by pat ashforth & steve plummer yarn the yarn shown in the photograph above was a 100 gram ball of grey and black lightweight chunky mixture that changes colour gradually along its length the scarf can be made in any thickness and any type of yarn thinner yarns will make thinner tails and you will need to make more of them you can use any yarn and even use up several oddments of different weights size my scarf is about 40 1 metre long but the tails make it seem longer make any size you want you may want to wear it round your waist instead of your neck hook use the hook recommended on the ball band or a slightly larger hook if you prefer a softer finish terminology uk crochet terms are used throughout method make a loose chain of about 25 stitches work one double_crochet into each chain until you reach the end work about 28 chains work back as before leaving the last three or four stitches unworked make another chain of about 25 stitches and work back as before leaving three or four chains between the tails continue in this way varying the lengths of the chains and the spacing between them at random continue until the scarf is the requied length work one row of double_crochet along the top edge until you reach the starting point fasten_off note if you are using a thinner yarn you may need to make longer chains to get the length you want you may also wish to leave larger or smaller spaces between the tails and change the size of the hook for different parts of the scarf using up yarn if you are in doubt about the amount of yarn you have work some of the tails then work the finishing row of double_crochet rejoin the yarn at the point where you left off and continue making tails and edging in the same way until you run out of yarn variations single or double-sided my original scarf was double-sided it has tails coming off both sides of the main length the second set of tails can be added as you work back along the long part of the scarf this makes interesting colour variations but when the scarf is worn it is more difficult to get some of the tails to go in the right direction multi-coloured change yarns after every few tails you can mix different weights to use up oddments use two strands at once for more variety beaded thread large beads onto your yarn before you start then position one at the bottom of the tails the scarf may be too heavy if you do this on every tail so space them randomly extra tails if you do not have enough tails in the finished scarf join the yarn into a space between tails crochet a chain of the length you want and work double_crochet back to where you started tails worked"
