    "content": "this is another free pattern because of its super easy construction this is a thick scarf knitted in aran wool using brioche stitch pattern i used hipwool from hipknitshop in the prototypes because of its softness and very colorful palette the blue prototype was knitted first using a little under 5 skeins i saved about 10 g of the last skein to make the fringes the second prototype was ment to be a bit longer but it became very much longer using just under 9 skeins i also saved about 10 g to make fringes for this one as well i m currently knitting another version using one strand of sport weight yarn held together with lace weight mohair i use the same stitch amount and the same needles this combination got the same gauge but a much less light fabric brioche stitch pattern becomes a very dense fabric and it will expand with use i have knitted this as a mindless knit doing a few row here and there it s something else than stockinette but it still is very easy because of the repetiveness remember that fixing mistakes in this stitch pattern is possible but a very irritating fix i recommend checking your stitches row by row and fixing mistakes by knitting back happy knitting"
