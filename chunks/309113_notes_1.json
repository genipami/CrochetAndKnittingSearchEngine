    "content": "henry s rabbit is a simple pattern that knits up fast and is a joy to make and give all pieces are knitted in the round so there is very little seaming finishing touches eyes nose and whiskers can be embroidered on or embellished with buttons pieces of felt etc finished size is about 12 inches long and 6 inches high at tallest point i knit loosely so if you re a tight knitter and want your rabbit to be the same size as mine consider going up a needle size this is the parent for my henry s bunny pattern"
