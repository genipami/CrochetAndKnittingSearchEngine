    "content": "this baby cardigan is worked from the top down it has raglan sleeves and is worked in one piece with no seams the front neck is shaped with short row wrap and turn method i designed this cardigan as a fun way to use small amounts of yarn left over from different projects it includes 7 different colours but of course you may use fewer or substitute as you wish the yarn i have used is similar to a sport weight but you may substitute 4-ply/fingering just check your gauge the instructions are given by row count rather than by measurement so the gauge swatch should be square if your gauge swatch is a smaller or larger square than mine the cardigan will still turn out fine but the finished size will be affected the pattern is only available in one size age 3-6 months follow me on instagram @tiemeinknits"
