    "content": "capacitor socks designed by shuyi wu notes mosaic knitting is my favourite technique - it looks complicated but is actually so simple to do you only work with one colour at a time and the only stitches are knits purls and slipped stitches i designed this sock pattern with the circuit symbol for a capacitor in mind however when i showed it to some friends all they could see was the letter i choose two yarns with high contrast and all i s will be on you as you rock your electrifying new socks there are 4 sizes s m l xl with 56 64 72 80 stitches per round the sock is worked cuff-down with a heel flap instructions are written and the mosaic pattern is both written and charted you may use any technique/needles you prefer for knitting a tube in the round supplies two colours of sock yarn with good contrast fingering weight wool/nylon mix - 75g main colour mc - 50g contrast colour cc - in the sample socks the neon green yarn is mc and the dark purple yarn is cc 2 5mm us1 5 needles or size needed to obtain gauge stitch markers yarn needle abbreviations st s = stitch es bor = beginning of round mc = main colour cc = contrast colour k = knit p = purl sl = slip 1 stitch purlwise with yarn to ws p2tog = purl 2 together k2tog = knit 2 together ssk = slip 1 knitwise slip 1 knitwise knit slipped stitches together through back loops rs = right side ws = wrong side capacitor socks v1 0 - shuyi wu - 1 gauge 8 stitches and 16 row = 1 inch in mosaic pattern feel free to adjust the gauge to get a fabric that you like don t be alarmed at the row gauge - the mosaic pattern compresses the row gauge by a fair amount instructions for the m and xl sizes the pattern is symmetric for the s and l sizes there will be an extra half repeat on one side of the instep if you are particular about having symmetric socks i recommend mirroring the second sock by starting the chart at row 9 cuff using a stretchy cast-on of your choice cast on 56 64 72 80 sts in mc join for working in the round and add a bor marker if you wish the cuff is worked in 2x2 rib as follows 2x2 rib *k2 p2* repeat from * to * until bor work the round above a total of 14 times or until desired length knit 1 round leg introduce cc and start following the chart each row of the chart uses one colour only - the slipped stitches are shown in the opposite colour to make it easier to visualize the pattern switch colours after every 2 rounds use cc for rounds 1-2 mc for rounds 3-4 etc when switching colours i drop the old yarn"
