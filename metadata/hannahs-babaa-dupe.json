  "notes": "why buy a designer sweater when you can make one? this pattern is a nod to the perfectly exaggerated silhouette and details of the brand babaa, but with my own tweaks for some personal flair. i hope you find it every bit as cozy as i do. \r\n\r\n**difficulty:** advanced beginner/intermediate. this pattern makes use of some shaping techniques, such as german short rows, lifted increases, picking up stitches, and sewn bind-offs.\r\n\r\n**sizing (please read):**this sweater is designed to have a very oversized fit - it has a lot of positive ease in the bust, hips, and shoulders, the neckline is larger than a typical drop-sleeve sweater, and the sleeves in the long version are intentionally knit to be longer than the average person’s arms. because of this, i have provided finished garment measurements in the sizing table so you can determine for yourself how exaggerated of a fit you would like.\r\n\r\nsizes (1, 2, 3) (4, 5, 6) (7, 8, 9) have **finished garment measurements** of:\r\n(40, 46, 51) (57, 64, 68) (75, 80, 86) in or\r\n*(100, 115, 128) (143, 158, 170) (185, 200, 213)* cm\r\n\r\nto fit a recommended bust size of:\r\n(28-30, 32-34, 36-38) (40-42, 44-46, 48-50) (52-54, 56-58, 60-62) in or\r\n*(75-80, 85-90, 95-100) (105-110, 115-120, 125-130) (135-140, 145-150, 155-160)* cm.\r\n\r\nif you are between sizes, i recommend sizing down.\r\n\r\nfor reference, my own measurements are as follows:\r\nbust: 41\"\r\nwaist: 30\"\r\nhips: 41\"\r\nheight: 5'7\"\r\n\r\nthe orange sample is a size 4, with the long sleeve and funnel neck option. this would be my \"recommended\" size from the sizing options.\r\n\r\nthe brown sample is a size 3, with the short sleeve and crew neck option.\r\n\r\n**materials:**\r\nsize us 10 (6 mm) and us 6 (4 mm) circular needles, stitch markers, tapestry needle\r\n\r\nfor the short sleeve/crew neck option, you will need:\r\n(950, 1160, 1330) (1620, 1820, 1980) (2130, 2370, 2530) yards or\r\n*(870, 1060, 1220) (1480, 1670, 1810) (1950, 2170, 2320)* meters\r\n\r\nfor the long sleeve/funnel neck option, you will need\r\n(1140, 1350, 1520) (1810, 2010, 2170) (2320, 2560, 2720) yards or\r\n*(1040, 1230, 1390) (1650, 1840, 1980) (2120, 2340, 2490)* meters\r\n\r\nof heavy worsted/aran weight yarn.\r\n\r\n",
