    "content": "crochet burial wraps inspired by betsy dey s knitted fetal demise pouch these wraps are designed to hold the tiny preemie babies that are too small or fragile to be dressed in other types of garments they are used both to present the babies to the families and for burial if the family chooses and may be kept as mementos notes * wrap is crocheted in two parts a mitered square for the back blanket portion of the wrap and a mitered triangle for the pouch then joined with single_crochet * i like to start my miters out with a magic magic_ring to avoid the messy holes i always get with the more traditional way the more traditional way is to start with a series of chains use whichever method you prefer * gauge is unimportant as long as the holes in the fabric are small enough that the baby won t be visible through them and tiny feet and hands don t get caught start with the hook size suggested on the yarn s ball band and adjust as needed keeping the fabric flexible and soft * the preemie project uses sizes as small as 10\u2033 up to 24-30\u2033 square at the time of this writing they are currently more in need of wraps in the medium to larger range * as always please let me know if something is unclear or incorrect i am not a skilled pattern writer abbreviations us terminology single_crochet = single_crochet double_crochet = double_crochet for the mitered square create a magic magic_ring then make 3 single_crochet in the ring alternatively chain 2 and make 3 single_crochet in the second stitch from the hook chain one turn single_crochet in the first stitch from the hook make 3 single_crochet in the next stitch single_crochet in the last stitch with each successive row add one more stitch before and after the center increases so the directions for row 3 would read single_crochet 2 make 3 single_crochet in next st single_crochet 2 directions for row 4 would read single_crochet 3 make 3 single_crochet in next st single_crochet 3 etc i lose count so i place a split ring as a marker in the middle stitch of the 3-single_crochet increase set many people will be able to just see where it goes mine wanders so i mark it continue adding row in this manner until the square reaches the size you need fasten_off for the mitered triangle begin as you did the square except start with 5 single_crochet in the ring alternatively chain four 2 single_crochet in second stitch from the hook 3 single_crochet the next stitch and 2 single_crochet in the last stitch continue as for the square except make 2 single_crochet in the first and last stitches in each row when the length of outer edges of the triangle match the length of the corresponding edges of your square in the last row make 3 single_crochet in the very last stitch rather than 2 and continue on"
