  "notes": "this pattern is not my design. it is a handed down and passed around pattern. i simply wrote it up to share with others because i love these potholders so much. i learned it from looking at potholders made before i was born. let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nupdate 04-dec-2012: helene (eclatdusoleil) has done a wonderful french translation (with more photos) of this pattern. [check it out here!.][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/manique-au-crochet-traduction"
