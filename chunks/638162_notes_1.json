    "content": "i much prefer a mitten to a glove - my hands are warmer for a start and there s something snuggly about mittens in the winter that speaks to me unfortunately they can be very impractical if you ve got to keep whipping them off to do things with your hands so here s the solution - split mittens the split across the palm allows you to slide your whole hand out but will still keep your hand warm and because you don t actually take the mitten off it doesn t get cold genius even if i say so myself you can find more information and a full photo tutorial through the link below 2022 pattern updated to include four sizes - now nobody needs to have cold hands"
