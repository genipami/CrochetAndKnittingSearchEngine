    "content": "the pattern includes asymmetric thumb gussets for better fit and uses the technique of stripey knitting can be knit in one color but with two colors the simple technique adds a lot of punch whichever color is used for the ribbing will have very little yarn leftover but one skein of each color should be sufficient note in the pattern there is a comment on gauge which is in error because these are snug gloves err on the side of fewer stitches per inch if you don t get exact gauge not more errata when starting back to work on the thumb use the appropriate color to maintain stripes that are single rounds of color the pattern is a bit misleading here"
