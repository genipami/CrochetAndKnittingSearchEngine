  "notes": "the day is getting longer and brighter. spring is near. that's when i get so excited to knit up some lace patterns. although the northern country is still deep in snow and ice, we are not quite ready for the thin lace materials. this scarf is designed to be knitted with worsted-weight yarn. it will give you a flutter of spring and the warmth needed to survive the rest of the cold weather.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is constructed with basic lace stitches and cable stitches. testers have rated the level as easy to medium. \r\n\r\n*sock yarn listed above was held together. \r\n\r\n"
