  "notes": "if you want to try this pattern, this is the information. the finished snoopy from charlie brown books, is exactly 8\" tall, 2 1/2\" wide at the body and 5 1/4\" wide at the arms. snoopy is mini compared to some other patterns i see on ravelry, and is entirely made up. the snoopy i made is an off white, and a midnight black. i do not know what kind the yarn is, but it feels like a super saver, so i put that on there. the finished product includes quite a bit of sewing and embroidery. happy crocheting!\r\n\r\nsc = single crochet\r\nmc = magic circle\r\nfo = finish off\r\n1 aro = 1 single crochet in each stitch around\r\nst = stitch\r\ndec = decrease\r\ninc = increase\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          \"good grief\""
