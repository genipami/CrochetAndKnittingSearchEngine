  "notes": "banana socks pattern—knitting wool socks can’t get any easier than this!\r\n\r\nmany craft enthusiasts on social media have been excited to knit banana socks, so we were inspired to design our own pattern! besides their playful appearance, these socks are also practical—and unbelievably easy to knit. the sock is knitted as a single tube without a heel, so they adjust effortlessly to a child’s growing foot. they also make an excellent gift for an adult whose shoe size you don’t know.\r\n\r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\n\r\n- 100 g of novita nalle yarn (75% wool, 25% polyamide, 100 g = 260 m) in color brass (shade 298); we used about 70 g of yarn for these sample socks\r\n- 3 mm (us 2.5) double-pointed needles or size needed to match gauge\r\n\r\ntip!\r\n\r\nyou can use a basic sock pattern to get the correct number of cast-on stitches for your work. if the wearer has wide feet or you want to leave room for growth in a child’s sock, add a few extra stitches.\r\n\r\nsize 22: 40 sts\r\nsize 24: 42 sts\r\nsize 26: 44 sts\r\nsize 28: 46 sts\r\nsize 30: 48 sts\r\nsize 32: 50 sts\r\nsize 34: 52 sts\r\nsize 36: 54 sts\r\nsize 40: 58 sts\r\nsize 42: 60 sts\r\nsize 44: 62 sts\r\nsize 46: 64 sts\r\nsize 48: 66 sts.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
