    "content": "i developed the pattern to make a narrow light weight scarf that can be used as a fashion accent it s an easy 24 row repeating stitch pattern with 23 row of garter stitch and 1 row of eyelets it is a very forgiving pattern forget to make the eyelets on row 23 make them on row 21 or 25 no one will notice the pattern can be made with any fingering weight yarn perfect for that souvenir single skein of variegated indie dye yarn that s been sitting forever in stash after blocking the scarf measures 88 inches by 4 5 inches your milage may vary want a narrower less flowy scarf use a us #3 or even a us #2 needle note correction in pattern there was an extra k at the beginning of decrease section of the eyelet row this caused the stitch count to be off by one too many stitches revised pattern has been uploaded - version is noted as v2-6may2025"
