    "content": "because of this consider skipping 10-12 rounds on the front of the tail to attach a larger area to the body for the orange squirrel see pictures below which i added to 2 row to rounds 6-7 and 1 row to round 9-10 if you want to shorten the tail i suggest getting rid of rounds 10 13 16 and/or 23 assembly the instructions for assembly might seem a bit cumbersome sorry for this but please refer to the pictures hopefully they will be helpful use the tapestry needle to assemble the squirrel the photos are meant to be a reference feel free to alter the design to your preference try pinning your squirrel together and adjust the features as you like 1 start by pinning the head which already has the eye patches/eyes and ears attached to the body the center of front of the body is where the yarn tail is positioned sew head on to body once pinned ears need to be attached still pinned tummy 2 next pin the tummy to the body centering under the head i positioned the bottom of the tummy at round 7 of the body the tummy is oriented with round 1 at the top under the head of the squirrel weave in tail 3 pin the legs on either side of the body approximating the tummy but not too close so you can sew the legs on easier the bottom edge of the leg will be around round 6 of the body the leg should be high enough that the foot can be positioned underneath it but low enough that the squirrel can balance once the foot is attached also the arms will be sewn above the leg so leave enough space for them sew only the side closest to the body not through both layers start by sewing around the rounded edges of the leg and leave round 13 of the leg the opening to the end this will allow you to sew the leg in place and lightly stuff the leg with polyfill between the leg and body note the polyfill doesn t go in the leg but instead between the leg and body after stuffing sew the back part of round 13 of the leg touching the body to the body the other half of round 13 of the leg front will be sewn to the foot leave the tail attached as you will sew the foot on using this tail repeat on other leg pin legs don t place too close to stuff polyfil between tummy leg & body sew back of round 13 to leg front edge will be sewed to foot leave tail attached as it will sew back side of leg to body not through both front & back be used to attach foot note it s easier to sew side closest to tummy 1st not like i did sew in this direction here or noted in instructions attach back layer of leg"
