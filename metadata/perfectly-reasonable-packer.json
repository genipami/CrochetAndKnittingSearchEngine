  "notes": "**the dongalong story:**\r\n\r\nin october 2019, i read a post in a facebook group about a trans man whose packer was taken away when he was admitted to the mental health department of a hospital. his friend and ally had posted pictures of the crocheted packer she'd made him as a replacement.\r\n\r\nfirst, i had to figure out what a packer was (which didn't take long - there were pictures). then i had to ask a friend who is an lpn in inpatient mental health why packers might be taken away. this led to a long and winding conversation with him, contacts in the trans community, and several others, which in turn led to the organization of [dongalong 2019][1]: a month long knitalong/crochetalong campaign to design, produce, and distribute five dozen packers and two dozen pairs of knockers (breast forms) to trans and non-binary youth and adults in our area for the holidays. \r\n\r\nthe dongalong story was [picked up by the local newspaper][2] and cbc radio and from there spread to other parts of nova scotia and other provinces entirely. i'm super excited to see that there are knitters and crocheters in other parts of the country who are either planning to make packers and knockers to donate locally or even to organize their own dongalongs. \r\n\r\nneed help, support, information, or resources related to being lgbtq2s? [check out the ns youth project.][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n**about the packer pattern itself:**\r\n\r\nthe patterns for packers (or packer-like objects) i found online were either comically shaped for gag gifts or oversized for drag kings. larger than life is fine for special occasions, but i wanted to make packers a realistic size and shape for every day, casual wear. this pattern should result in a packer that's right around the size of average male genitalia (see notes in the pattern), but instructions are included to make it larger or smaller if desired. gauge and yarn choice will also determine finished size. \r\n\r\neta: \r\n\r\nnow that packers and knockers are coming in from a variety of crocheters, i’ve realized that my gauge is tighter than most peoples’. i’ve added my gauge numbers to the stats above and closeups of my fabric to the photos so that you can see how firm the fabric needs to be so that the stuffing doesn’t show through. i find it difficult to crochet a fabric this firm with a wooden hook and have switched to metal hooks because of this.\r\n\r\nalso/soon to be available:\r\n\r\n[knit packer pattern][4]\r\n[crocheted knocker pattern][5]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.facebook.com/events/723522851492468\r\n  [2]: https://www.capebretonpost.com/lifestyles/local-lifestyles/dongalong-in-sydney-helping-provide-packers-knockers-for-transgender-non-binary-people-378163\r\n  [3]: https://youthproject.ns.ca/resources/resources-and-information/\r\n  [4]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/knit-packer\r\n  [5]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/quick--easy-round-knocker"
