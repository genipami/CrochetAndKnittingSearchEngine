  "notes": "there is a video tutorial included, which is particularly helpful if this is your first time crocheting a toe-up sock with a short row heel.\r\n\r\n**materials:**\r\n\r\nworsted weight yarn (vanna’s choice in “navy” and “linen” pictured, wool of the andes tweed in “flagstone heather” pictured)\r\n-approx. 110 yards per pair for women’s size 5 – 6\r\n-approx. 160 yards per pair for women’s size 7 – 9\r\n-approx. 232 yards per pair for women’s size 10 – 11/men’s size 8 – 9\r\n-approx. 240 yards per pair for men’s size 10 – 11\r\n-approx. 250 yards per pair for men’s size 12 – 13\r\n\r\ncrochet hook in size h/5mm\r\n\r\nplenty of stitch markers\r\n\r\nfor this pattern we are using the linked double crochet stitch. this is a stitch that does not have a lot of bumps on back side (inside of the foot), meaning that it should not aggravate the soles of your feet like other stitches might."
