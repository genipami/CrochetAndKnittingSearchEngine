    "content": "this triangle scarf pattern was made with the idea of simplicity in mind i love a one skein project with repetitive stitches and a triangle scarf was on my mind i also love the look of moss stitch aka linen stitch or grit stitch once you get through the first two rounds this project repeats the same steps until you re done the madeline triangle scarf is a beginner level pattern check out the video at the end for a tutorial if reading patterns isn t your favorite one issue i ve had with triangle scarves is having the ends come undone this one is wide enough so it doesn t come undone and adding tassels makes it even better"
