  "notes": "i've been in our attic a lot over the last year.  it might not sound particularly glamorous and to be honest, it wasn't - but i found inspiration for a pair of socks!\r\n\r\nin amongst the boxes of stuff was an abacus that has been passed down the generations in our family - i can remember playing with it, i remember my brother having it too, and my girls loved being able to move the beads from one side of the bar to the other.  such a simple thing, but excellent for a baby's hand-eye co-ordination!\r\n\r\nit was those beads that caught my eye and the pattern for this pair of socks formed in my mind even as i stood in the attic with the abacus in my hands.\r\n\r\nthe abacus socks are simple socks, and knitting them will be excellent for your hand-eye co-ordination as well ... the benefits of the wooden abacus are not confined to our family!"
