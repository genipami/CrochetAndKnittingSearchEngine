  "notes": "this is my go-to basic sock recipe that i use when knitting up a variety of fingering weight (4ply) cuff down socks.  this recipe is the ‘home base’ for most of my socks – a concept that inspired the name, as melbourne is my home base.  \r\n\r\ni tend to mix and match the heel and stitch patterns when knitting my own socks depending on the yarn and the kind of mood i am in.  this pattern contains a few options for cuffs, heels and stitch patterns.  \r\n\r\nyou will need between 50g - 100g of sock yarn, depending on the size of your foot and your preferred leg length.  so pick out some amazing yarn, grab your preferred sock needles - magic loop, 9 inch circular, dpns, flexible dpns - and cast on with wild abandon!\r\n\r\ni hope this helps you with your sock knitting and that you have as much fun as i do knitting up all your new socks!\r\n\r\nthis is a free pattern and while it has been fully tech edited, it has only been formally tested by me.  i warmly welcome any feedback or questions if the instructions are not clear.\r\n\r\nhappy making!\r\n\r\nkath xx\r\n",
