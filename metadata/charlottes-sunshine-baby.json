  "notes": "charlotte's sunshine baby started her life as an adaptation and ravelry project by the lovely [misty babcock][1].  it features the [charlotte square][2] by dedri uys, a few modified rounds from the [sunshine owl cal][3] by vanessa smith, and additional rounds by misty herself.\r\n\r\nwe have had countless requests for this pattern, so the three of us are pleased to announce that the pattern is now available on the look at what i made website.\r\n\r\ndue to the chunky nature of the yarn, it grows quite quickly and makes for a lovely weighty blanket.  tightening your tension further would yield a gorgeous tummy-time rug with lots of texture and surface interest.\r\n\r\nwe hope you enjoy this blanket!\r\n\r\nmisty, vanessa, and dedri.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/projects/winklepicker/charlotte\r\n  [2]: https://ravelry.com/patterns/library/charlotte-54\r\n  [3]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/the-sunshine-owl-cal"
