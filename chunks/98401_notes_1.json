    "content": "pattern can also be made with sugar and cream or similar dishcloth cotton wool or wool/cotton blend yarn do not use an acrylic for this pattern acrylic yarns can melt in high heat circumstances **pattern clarification ** the pattern states for you to crochet into the hump of the chain stitch for the second row of stitches by this i mean the chain stitch is made up of 3 loops 2 on the chain side and one on the back side of the chain the hump is the loop on the back side of the chain you can actually crochet into either of the remaining loops however i have found it easiest to crochet the border round into the remaining chain stitch rather than the hump stitch"
