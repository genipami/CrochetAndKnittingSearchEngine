    "content": "the same direction around your sock pick up and knit stitches on the remaining side of the flap remember to pick up 1/4 of your sock number of stitches just like with needle 1 if you want to do the fancy-pants no-holes pick-up like on needle 1 do it at the beginning of this needle then using the same needle knit the stitches from needle 4 as normal so what you should end up with is needles 1 and 4 a whole lot of stitches both should have the same number needles 2 and 3 both of these should have stitches equal to a quarter of your sock number if you fold your sock in half it should look kind of like this quite sock-like i think 7 gusset the next step is the sock gusset i always feel like gusset is a vaguely dirty word i don t know why though i guess i m just being weird anyway the sock gusset is the part of the foot right next to the heel to make the gusset you ll decrease two stitches every other row until you re back down to your sock number of stitches it s super easy and kind of fun watching your little decreases line up nicely so remember how your needles were numbered starting at the back of the heel/bottom of the foot and working your way around in the knitting direction like this so needles 1 and 4 are the bottom of the foot and needles 2 and 3 are the top of the foot see how there are approximately a billion stitches on needles 1 and 4 and see how there are only stitches equal to 1/4 of your sock number on needles 2 and 3 we are going to decrease stitches on needles 1 and 4 until they also only have 1/4 of your sock number does that make sense i can t actually see your response but i m going to assume you are nodding or at least giving me a blank look ok so here s what we re going to do \uf0b7 row 1 knit to two stitches before the end of needle 1 knit these two stitches together k2tog knit needles 2 and 3 with no decreases on needle 4 slip slip knit ssk then knit to the end of the row you will have decreased 2 stitches on this row if you need a reminder about the difference between k2tog and ssk try this video \uf0b7 row 2 knit even no decreases repeat row 1 and 2 until all of your needles have the same number of stitches see how the decreases line up nicely and make cool triangle-y shapes on both sides of your sock that s your gusset 8 this step is the instep this step is stupid easy we re going to make this instep of the sock the folks that write books about knitting call this the instep but i think it"
