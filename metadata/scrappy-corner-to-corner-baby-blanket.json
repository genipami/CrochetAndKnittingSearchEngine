  "notes": "if you are like me and hate weaving in yarn ends, you are going to love making these scrappy blankets with a magic yarn ball.\r\n\r\nusing an easy invisible yarn joining technique, hundreds of little scraps can be joined to make a giant continuous ball of yarn, in a fun rainbow of colours then crocheted together with no ends to weave in later. \r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy using up your leftover yarn ends to make these fun scrap yarn crochet blankets.\r\n\r\nany combination of dk or worsted yarn is suitable. \r\n\r\n**you will need:**\r\n\r\n* a large magic yarn ball make from yarn scraps (around 600g / 21 oz) – dk to worsted weight (8-10ply) \r\n* 5mm crochet hook\r\n\r\nfinished size – 75cm x 95cm (30″x38″)"
