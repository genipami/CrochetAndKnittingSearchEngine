    "content": "this cozy earwarmer is a recreation of a fond memory i have from the pre-kids era where i knit these by custom order now that i have kids of my own i decided to bring these back to keep their ears warm during the cold winters everyday earwarmer wraps around the head from ear to ear providing warmth while staying secure with ties under the chin perfect for stash-busting this project works beautifully with any yarn weight - from fingering to bulky - making it ideal for using up leftover yarn worked flat from one i-cord tie to the other the piece features triangular ear flaps shaped with increases and decreases connected by a straight center panel over the crown a slipped center stitch creates a clean vertical line through the ear flaps this pattern emphasizes flexibility and customization measurements are guidance only - knit to your desired width and length try on as you work and achieve a perfect fit for any head size note the earwarmers in the photos were knit using malabrigo rios peachy aquamarine and linea boucle ivory with 4 5mm needles"
