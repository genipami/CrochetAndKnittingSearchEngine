  "notes": "**description:** this hot water bottle cover is knit top down from the cuff and seamed at the bottom using kitchener stitch. it is a perfect gift knit as it works up in just a couple of hours, and anyone would love a mini hot water bottle to carry around in winter! it’s great for stash busting and using up precious hand-dyed scraps since you only need 35g yarn. any other yarn/needle combination can be used if it achieves gauge, and the pattern is easily adaptable to meet other gauges. in order for this pattern to fit well, use the hot water bottle linked above or one with similar dimensions (4.5 inch x 4.5 inch body, 3.5 inch wide spout; *see pattern for schematic*). this pattern includes one size only, made to fit [this hot water bottle][1]. this pattern is beginner friendly and a good way to practice working in the round with magic loop and learning decrease stitches. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.amazon.com/dp/b0dq7mgkh2?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1\r\n\r\n**materials:** \r\n- 3.5 mm needles (80 or 100 cm circulars for magic loop method. can be adapted to work with dpns or small circulars)\r\n- 35 g fingering weight yarn held double, or 70 g dk weight yarn held single, or any other yarn able to meet gauge.\r\n- scissors\r\n- tapestry needle for kitchener stitch and weaving in ends \r\n\r\n**gauge:** 24 st per 4 inches in stockinette. *no row gauge is needed, because the length is based off measurements only.*\r\n\r\nif you are a more experienced knitter, it would be very easy to alter the pattern to use off-gauge yarn.
