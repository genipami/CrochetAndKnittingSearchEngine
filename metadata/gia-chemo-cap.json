  "notes": "this cute chemo cap was designed with chemo patients in mind! \r\n\r\nfinished hat will be approximately 19.5\" unstretched, but will fit a head 20\" to 22\" which is an average adult head (if you are making it for someone who has a smaller head with no hair, cast on 88\" or use a thinner yarn and a us6 needle)\r\n\r\nyou will need around 60-70g of worsted weight yarn, but i put down a 100g ball just to make sure you don't run out!\r\n\r\ni made this chemo cap pattern free so that it can be made and shared with those in need. hopefully it will make a very rough time a little bit better!",
