  "notes": "the basic ribbed beanie is a cold weather classic.  this one is knit up in a bulky weight and is super quick and easy to make. it is one of my go-to beanies, one size fits most with an awesome stretch, and looks great on everyone. a folded rim covers ears and adds extra warmth and coziness on cold days.\r\n\r\nthe pattern starts with a tighter gauge for the rim before switching up to larger needles. a quick decrease on the crown gives a nice round shape at the top. the rim can be unfolded for a fun slouchy look too.\r\n\r\nsize\r\ncircumference 22″-24″ (56cm -61cm)\r\nlength 9.5″ (24cm) folded, 11.5″ (29cm) unfolded"
