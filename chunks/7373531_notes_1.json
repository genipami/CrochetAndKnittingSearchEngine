    "content": "**difficulty ** confident beginner - intermediate **design ** the court socks combine sporty double stripes at the cuff and toe with an irregular half-twisted rib texture leaning into the athletic look the samples are knit with a minimal ankle-length leg however the leg length can be customised whilst many ribbed socks feature a ribbed cuff the court socks have a rolled cuff worked in stockinette stitch this allows knitters who are new to knitting magic loop to get comfortable with the technique before having to incorporate ribbed stitches **about the pattern ** there are three pdfs provided with a purchase of the court socks pattern the first is the **confident beginner - intermediate** pdf this iteration of the pattern is written for people who have some knitting experience but who have not yet knit socks it includes a series of advisory notes guiding you through techniques that you might be unfamiliar with whilst you don t need to have previously knit a sock to follow this version of the pattern prior experience with a shaped garment such as a hat glove jumper or cardigan is recommended the second document is the **intermediate** pdf the instructions in this version are more sparse and are intended for knitters familiar with working socks and stripes the third document includes instructions for working the **tricolour modification** a version of the design which features stripes in three different colours at both the cuff and toe a playlist of video tutorials is available on youtube for both versions the **confident beginner - intermediate** and **intermediate** instruction pdfs are both relatively long as there are different instructions for sizes 1 - 3 - 5 - and sizes - 2 4 - 6 if you are printing the pattern you may want to choose your size before printing see pages 3-4 you can then print just the pages relevant to your size **construction ** these socks are knit cuff-down first you cast on at the cuff and work eight rounds in stockinette to create a rolled hem you then work the leg in the half-twisted rib pattern incorporating two cc stripes the heel is then worked using the heel flap and gusset technique next the foot of the sock is worked with the established half-twisted rib pattern continuing on the in-step the sole of the foot is knit in plain stockinette for comfort a further two cc stripes are worked before the toes there are two toe shaping options the first is a classic wedge toe which is worked the same across both socks and the second is a shaped left and right toe which differs for each sock the in-step ribbing is symmetrical for the odd sizes and asymmetrical for the even sizes this means that the odd sizes have just one set of instructions to follow for both of the socks starting on page 5 meanwhile the even sizes have two sets of instructions to follow so that the right and left socks mirror each other"
