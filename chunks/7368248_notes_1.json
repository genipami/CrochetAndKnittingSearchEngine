    "content": "i really like making these little hats since they are a fast and easy way to use up little bits of yarn and they have a better texture than caps made in single_crochet this pattern is made in dk or sport weight yarn and a size g 4 mm hook it uses the extended chain technique that i learned from mon petit violon s hexagon sweater to reduce the visibility of the end of round joins i like to edge these caps with shell stitches which adds a little visual interest while keeping the design unisex for the brim all the rounds are worked on the wrong side so that the right side of brim will face out when folded up and the first round of the brim is worked in single_crochet both to create a distinct fold line and to keep the bottom of the hat from being too loose"
