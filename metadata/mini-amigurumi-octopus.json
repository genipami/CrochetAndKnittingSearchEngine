  "notes": "update october 2021 - i have taken the decision to cease publishing patterns as of summer 2021, in the hope of moving on to something new. i wanted to say a big thank you to everyone for the love my work has received over the years - it means more than you can imagine! \r\nthe free patterns that are on my blog will remain, though all paid patterns from my ravelry store and etsy are no longer available. \r\nif you would like to sell anything made from any of my past patterns - paid or free - you have my full blessing. i don’t require credit either as i am no longer using the esshaych name professionally. i wish you all the best with the sales if you decide to do so! \r\nthanks so much again - and i hope to see you again, one day soon! \r\nsarah \r\n-x-\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**update august 2015** i have updated the pattern to include a full photo tutorial <3\r\n\r\n**pattern update:** i have recently learnt a way of making the legs for this octopus all in one piece, so i updated the pattern to include this. if you would like the version that makes the legs individually, please see the link below :)\r\n\r\n[old version][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://esshaych.blogspot.com/2010/04/small-ami-octopus-pattern.html"
