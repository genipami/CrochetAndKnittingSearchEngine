    "content": "to checkpoint 2 how precise do i have to be at each of the checkpoints if your fabric is within 1/8 inch of your target width at each checkpoint you re ok if your fabric is too wide or too narrow by 1/4 inch or more you will have to make adjustments to compensate my fabric width is off target what do i do you can course-correct during stage 2 if your row gauge is taller than target work fewer row in stage 2 if your row gauge is shorter work more row for more details on diagnosing the problem and prescribing the correct fix refer to troubleshooting the fit below the leg doesn t fit me very well how can i modify this to fit me better if the leg is too small but the sock is otherwise a good fit you can work some additional short row at the cuff during stage 4 if the leg is too large you can use a more elastic fabric on the leg see variations section below for some examples i don t get it\u2026 before the graft the sock is 12 inches long and 7 inches wide but after the graft it s 9 1/2 inches long and 8 inches around wtf the point is you re not just folding it in half when you graft something knit on the bias it s like wrapping an ace bandage you start out with something long and narrow and as you wrap around your foot it transforms into something shorter and wider here s a little exercise you can try at home that might help you visualize this mathematical principle troubleshooting the fit the most common issues with wraptor relate to either or both of 1 adjusting the elasticity of the leg to fit a slender ankle and calf 2 adjusting the width to compensate for being off target at the checkpoints note that all of the troubleshooting tips below assume you are working to the requisite stitch gauge of 8 st/inch adjusting the elasticity of the leg wraptor has to be large enough to fit your foot through but not so large that it s then too big for your calves and ankles for people with a normal instep and a slender ankle/calf wraptor might be a little loose above the heel one way around this is to use a more elastic fabric on all or part of your sock see variations section below for two possible approaches to this predicament adjusting the width at the checkpoints wraptor is divided into 3 sections referred to as stages in the pattern each stage is roughly 1/3 of the total width the row count for stages 1 and 3 is set at 12 because of the toe shaping but you have some flexibility in how many row you work during stage 2 checkpoint 1 gives you an indicator of whether or not you will need to make adjustments to your row count later on"
