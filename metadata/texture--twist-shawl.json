  "notes": "like this pattern? i volunteer at the loose ends project, and i’d love it if you’d consider a [small donation][1] to help them match volunteer crafters like myself to families with unfinished projects left behind due to disability, illness or loss of a loved one!\r\n\r\nthis pattern is a collaboration with the hamilton fibre forge in ontario, canada. it was designed to showcase the different type of yarns one might find at a small scale fibre festival - from small batch farm yarns to indie dyed gradient sets, this quick and easy pattern will work with them all!\r\n\r\nit's a triangular shawl, knit from the top left corner and worked diagonally to the lower right edge. a simple combination of stockinette and garter stitch are accented by an interesting lace pattern and twisted stitches.\r\n\r\nthis pattern includes both charts and written instructions, and features a \"knit until you run out of yarn\" style construction, that provides notes on sizing up. two suggested sizes are illustrated, using two different yarns.\r\n\r\nen dansk version findes her.\r\nhttps://strikkeglad.dk/54743/tekstursjal/\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.looseends.org/donate",
