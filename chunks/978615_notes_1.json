    "content": "this is my first published pattern i found this great skein of dk weight yarn in just the right colors on etsy called friday night fibers by sharpin designs and thought it would make a great beanie for my son patrick to wear for his beloved browns whose team colors are orange and brown first i found the rhinefleck hat and liked the look of it but wanted the crispness of k1tbl x p1 ribbing for the brim and i was not a big fan of the seed stitch ribbing for the body of the hat so i guess i designed a new pattern loosely based on the rhinefleck this beanie is designed for a small adult head and can be made bigger by casting on multiples of 8 stitches plus one for joining in the round i created this crown to maintain the 3 knit stitch ribs until the very last few row and i love how it turned out i used part of one skein of dk weight yarn or about 170 yards after i test it using other weights and needle sized i will add notes here"
