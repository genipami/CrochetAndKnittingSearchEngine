  "notes": "adult s (m, l) \r\nfinished measurements (unstretched): 7.5 (8, 9)” (stretches comfortably up to about 11 (12, 13)” \r\ncircumference). leg and foot lengths vary depending on knitter’s preference.\r\n\r\n**why toe up socks?**\r\ni was a die hard top-down sock knitter for years! i thought that sock knitter’s fell in one camp or the other, that it was simply a personal preference and that my preference was for top down sock knitting. turns out that’s not exactly true, some sock projects and yarns are better suited to a toe up construction. i like knitting my socks toe up when using self striping yarns because though i’m usually quite flexible about the length of the leg of my sock, the foot has to be a very precise length in order to fit properly. in order to make sure that the stripes fall exactly how i want them to it’s easiest to start with the toe and then end on the leg whenever i want. using this same logic i like knitting my socks toe up whenever i’m trying to maximize my yardage. i can knit the socks longer and longer until i run out of yarn, or, inversely, stop as soon as i’ve used up 50% to ensure that i’ll have enough yardage remaining\r\nfor the second sock.",
