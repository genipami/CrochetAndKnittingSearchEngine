  "notes": "i had the great pleasure of designing the 12\" main october square for bamcal 2024. it's named after the goddess of abundance, fruit trees, gardens, and orchards in ancient roman religion and myth. the name pomona comes from the latin word *pomum* which means orchard fruit. \r\n\r\nwritten pattern with step-by-step photos.\r\n\r\nskill level: intermediate.\r\n\r\nstitches used: sc, fpsc, hdc, fp/bphdc, dc, fpdc, tr, fptr, popcorn.\r\n\r\nthe pattern calls for aran weight yarn, but you can use any yarn with a suitable hook. please note that this will affect the size of your square. \r\n"
