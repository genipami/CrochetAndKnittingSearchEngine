    "content": "this pattern is a mod of my movie night shawl i tweaked it so that it would be narrower more scarf-like and more dramatically asymmetrical i also wanted to give it more of a saw-tooth bottom border i was very pleased with how it turned out and what a generous size i could get with a single skein so i decided to share it with all of you i hope you like it as much as i do with a pattern that is easy to remember and quick to work up you ll be enjoying this design before you know it there is a video tutorial on youtube by fiberspider for an absolutely gorgeous modification of this pattern to make it more symmetrical you can follow the tutorial until the decreases begin for my pattern or you can continue on with his decreases to make it look more like his mod 1 **update ** i have recently worked a variation of night moves that makes a top edge with a far more pronounced curve last picture to help it rest better on the shoulders very minor mods it s essentially this exact pattern except 1 the top edge has increase shells for every row rather than every other row and 2 for the sawtooth edge you don t work into the last shell every 2nd row rather than every 4th row for some reason my brain is totally short circuiting when i think about writing this up as a pattern but i still wanted to share it i hope you like it last pattern pic shows this mod user annyoneg2 has very kindly translated this pattern into dutch thanks so much annyoneg2 **items made from my patterns are intended for personal use sale or world domination--as long as i get a parking space wherever i want once the world is yours ** 1 https //www youtube com/watch v=4mk_pvsoqz8"
