    "content": "just an estimate of the yarn needed be sure to allow yourself some extra yarn over the amount calculated calculate the number of stitches to cast on multiply the number of stitches per inch by the width you want to make the wrap round up or down to a whole number for example if you want it to be 15 wide and your gauge is 4 5 stitches per inch 4 5 x 15 = 67 5 so you would probably want to cast on 68 stitches choose your construction method seamed or seamless the seamed version easier to adjust for size and gives you the chance to decide how big you want the neck opening to be so it might be a better choice if you are making it for the first time but if you don t want a seam or if your yarn would look better without a seam you might prefer that option same thing only different v1 0 page 4 of 5 copyright 2012 - cheryl schumer plan your edge stitches the linen version i did has a 3-stitch garter stitch edge on the long edges this made a wide decorative stripe of textured stitches in the center which helps disguise the fact that it s a seam you may prefer to use a different stitch for the edges or leave it as plain stockinette you might also want to try different edge stitches on the inside and outside edges since one side will form the bottom edge of the wrap the other side will form the neckline and the optional seam line for example you might want to work a simple lace edging on one edge for the bottom hem and leave the other edge plain to just roll in at the neck get started follow the instructions for the seamless or seamed version substituting your own choices as needed keep in mind that your wrap may change in size after blocking if you are concerned about the length stop knitting when you are a few inches short of your target length put the work-in-progress on some waste yarn and block it then you can decide how much longer you need to go before binding off additional modification ideas rather than seaming or using the provisional cast-on option you could create buttonholes along one edge for the first 15 of the rectangle and then attach buttons to the opposite end along the same edge as the buttonholes this would give you the option of wearing the wrap as a scarf or buttoning it to form the wrap sew decorative buttons down the center back seam add beads aside from being decorative this may help to add drape to your finished fabric pick up the edge stitches along what will be the bottom edge when worn and work a decorative border this would also be a good way to widen the wrap after it s finished if you decide it s too narrow \u00a9 copyright"
