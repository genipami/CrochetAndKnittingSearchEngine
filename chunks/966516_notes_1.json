    "content": "the original idea for this doughnut pattern was to make something small enough to fit into the pocket of my dungarees pattern and although it is a little tight it does just fit dungarees and pinafore pattern is here dungarees 1 i tried so many prototypes trying to reduce the size further but they didn t work out as circular so this was as small as i could go and therefore the pattern is recommended to be worked with very thin needles 2 25mm us 1 in order that the doughnut made fits into the dungaree pocket if you do intend it for this purpose then please use a thin 4ply yarn with the 2 25mm/us 1 needles check your gauge and don t be too generous with the amount of stuffing that you use if you prefer you can use the doughnut as a stand-alone item size is then less important and you can knit it in dk weight yarn with 3mm needles to give a slightly larger size 1 https //www ravelry com/patterns/library/dungarees-and-pinafore-dress"
