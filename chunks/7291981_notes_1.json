    "content": "this crochet fall garland combines my love of fall garlands and animals i think it is very relaxing and rewarding to crochet small motifs there are so many great projects you can create with motifs these fall-themed motifs could be appliqued onto a bag or afghan if the garland design isn t your thing or they could be attached to a wooden skewer and added to a fall floral arrangement you may want to add felt to the back of each motif for extra stability this crochet fall garland is sure to please with its easy stitches and simple construction i think you ll love adding it to your home decor this autumn"
