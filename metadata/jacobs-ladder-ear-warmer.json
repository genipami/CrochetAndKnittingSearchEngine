  "notes": "this is a simple, beginner-friendly, and quick crochet ear warmer with a jacob's ladder cable stitch detail. it takes 50g of dk yarn and a 4mm hook so it's also a great stash-buster! \r\n\r\nthis ear warmer is made flat and worked until 19 inches of length before being seamed up at the back. it is adjustable if this doesn't fit you. the pattern uses uk terms and chain, double, and treble crochet stitches. \r\n\r\ngauge isn't important for this pattern, but please use a dk weight yarn.
