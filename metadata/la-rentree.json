  "notes": "find kits [here][1] :-)\r\n\r\n'la rentrée' marks the return to school, work, and the rhythm of daily life. a time to leave behind the ease of summer and embrace the crisp, energizing promise of fall. this sweater pattern embodies this transition beautifully. the light, cozy fabric offers effortless warmth, while the folded neckline adds a touch of comfort. breezy statement sleeves balance relaxed elegance with structure, accentuated by ribbed details. it’s the perfect blend of summer's laid-back energy and the renewed focus on fall routines.\r\n\r\n**sizes**\r\n\r\n1 (2, 3, 4) (5, 6, 7) (8, 9, 10)\r\nfinished chest circumference: \r\n41.25 (44.75, 46.75, 51.5) (54, 55.25, 57.25) (61.5, 65.75, 72)\"\r\n105 (113.5, 118.5, 130.5) (137, 140, 145.5) (156, 167, 183) cm\r\n\r\nmeasurements above are given for the finished circumference measured at underarms. this sweater is designed to be worn with approximately 6-10\" / 15 - 25.5 cm of positive ease; however, this is just a guide. some people prefer a closer fit; do not be afraid to select an option that provides somewhat less than the suggested ease according to your own preferences.\r\n\r\n**yarn**\r\n\r\nsonder yarn co. halo (72% mohair, 28% silk); 420 m (459 y) / 50 g\r\n4 (4, 5, 5) (5, 6, 6) (6, 6, 7) skeins\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n1728 (1840, 1950, 2150, 2260, 2380, 2510, 2660, 2800, 3060) yds / 1580 (1680, 1780, 1966, 2068, 2180, 2300, 2435, 2565, 2800) m \r\nof fluffy laceweight yarn.\r\n\r\nnote! \r\n2 strands of laceweight yarn are held together throughout. while the length of the body and sleeves are easily customized, adding length will affect yardage requirements. \r\n\r\n*while gauge is technically 'worsted', when substituting with a single strand i recommend using a dk / light worsted weight yarn*.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://sonderyarnco.com/products/la-rentree-by-melissa-clulow?variant=45897117008117",
