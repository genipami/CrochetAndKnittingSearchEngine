  "notes": "this super chunky mesh overshirt is my way of getting my crojo back this summer. i love a tiny yarn, cotton lacey project as much as the next guy but without that instant gratification from quick chunky knits, my crafting motivation always tends to waffle a bit in the middle of the summer.\r\n\r\nwith loopy mango's big cotton, we can make a beachy coverup super fast! and help get some of that crafting momentum restarted again.\r\n\r\nplease enjoy the free pattern and video tutorial! :) "
