  "notes": "\r\nthis hat was designed during a very tough time for me and my family, and it was knit with you all in my mind.\r\n\r\nduring this time, we have had such a huge amount of support and love from all of you.  i really wanted to do something to give a little back, and show you all just how much it has meant to us.\r\n\r\ni named this the angel hat because you are all angels to us !\r\n\r\nthe hat is knit in an aran weight yarn but would work equally as well in a worsted weight.  it is sized to fit most adult heads, with just a little bit of slouch - my favourite !  it has a simple textured pattern that works for both men and women, and it a fun quick knit.\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy it !\r\nkay x",
