  "notes": "vivaldi autumn mitts is the third pair in ***the four seasons*** collection.\r\n\r\nit is widely believed that antonio vivaldi’s inspiration for the four seasons stems from the time he spent as the court chapel master in the gorgeous countryside of mantua, italy.\r\n\r\nthis is autumn\r\nthe scent of woodsmoke curling from chimneys. vibrant leaves turned ocher, sienna, burgundy, crimson, and gold. a sense of quiet as they flutter and fall, and the earth settles into a season of stillness. darkness comes early beckoning us to turn inward and rest.\r\n\r\nthese mitts are sized for tiny, smallish, and larger hands using heavier yarn and larger needles.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is written for magic loop but can easily be adapted for dpns.\r\n\r\nthe lace portion is rhythmic, intuitive, easy to memorize and is \r\nwritten and charted. \r\n\r\nvivaldi autumn mitts have been test knit.\r\n\r\nin lieu of paying a fee for this pattern, please consider making a donation to                         **world central kitchen**. since 2010, world central kitchen has been providing meals to communities affected by conflict, natural disasters, and climate crisis all over the world. https://wck.org\r\n",
