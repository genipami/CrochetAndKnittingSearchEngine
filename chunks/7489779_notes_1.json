    "content": "> this is a free pattern but if you download it i only ask that you please save it to your favourites i d appreciate it so much <3 little ribbon is a very skinny decorative scarf with angled tips to emulate a cut ribbon it s mostly just a cute accessory but does provide a little bit of warmth and lots of softness this scarf is constructed using the double-knit technique which creates two layers of fabric at once a tube essentially wrap and turn short-row are used at the beginning and end of the scarf to create the angled ends this is a simple looking project however it uses some advanced techniques so in all honesty i do not recommend this pattern for beginners **techniques used in pattern ** long-tail tubular cast-on wrap and turn short- row double-knitting in one colour grafting kitchener stitch please note that since this pattern is free no pattern support / help can be provided use at your own risk **measurements** width 3cm / 1 25 inches wide length 127cm / 50 inches long from tip to tip length is adjustable make it as long or as short as you want **recommended yarn** sandnes garn cashmere sport/light dk 100% cashmere 110m / 120yds per 25g ball 1 ball or approximately 100m / 110yds i didn t quite use the whole ball **yarn substitutions and suggestions** here s a short non-exhaustive list of cashmere / cashmere blend yarn substitution ideas cardiff cashmere classic lamana como cashmere lang yarns cashmere premium rowan baby cashsoft merino if you don t have access to cashmere no worries there are many other fibres that will work just be sure to choose something that is soft and comfortable for you to wear around your neck think merino wool brushed alpaca mohair silk blends and acrylic blends fingering / sock weight yarn can also be used for this design just note that the overall fabric will be lighter and looser to counteract this consider holding a strand of lace weight mohair along with the fingering / sock yarn for added fluff and softness if a heavier dk yarn is used the scarf will be denser and might come out wider not bad things at all however you might consider using a larger needle size in this case to help the scarf keep it s drape **gauge** gauge is not that important for this pattern but here is the suggested gauge for reference 12 sts & 15 rounds = 5cm / 2 inches over double knit stitch on 3 5mm needles after blocking **needles** two 3 5mm / us 4 double pointed needles dpns if you don t have dpns a 40cm / 16 inches long circular needle can be used instead but i recommend the dpns **notions** removable stitch marker optional spare dpn yarn needle"
