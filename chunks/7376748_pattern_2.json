    "content": "on how tight your stitches are if you need to create more rounds follow the pattern of single_crochet and increase adding one to the number of scs each time even rounds are split in two with the increase in the middle to spread increases out and ensure the circle remains round for example the next round would be 14sc 7sc increase 7sc x6 then 15sc increase and so on\u2026 head round 1 create a magic_ring with 16sc you can also chain 16 and join with a slip_stitch if you first that easier don t pull the circle completely closed as you will need to be able to stuff the head round 2-11 16sc around fold the tube flat so that you have a top half and bottom half round 13 in the top half of the tube 8 single_crochet round 14 turn but don t not use a turning chain 7sc round 15 turn but don t not use a turning chain 6sc round 16 turn but don t not use a turning chain 5sc round 17 turn but don t not use a turning chain 4sc round 18 turn but don t not use a turning chain 3sc round 19 turn but don t not use a turning chain 2sc round 20 turn but don t not use a turning chain 1sc slip_stitch to cast off on the bottom side of the tube repeat rounds 13-19 fold the two tringles inwards to create the mouth shape this will help you work out where to place the safety eyes roughly round 10/11 but this can be altered to personal preference once the eyes are secured unfold the mouth and sew along the two diagonal sides before folding the mouth back inwards if you prefer you can add the eyes after this by using the open end of the magic_ring however this may be fiddlier inside of the mouth round 1 create a magic_ring with 4 single_crochet round 2 increase each stitch around x4 8sc fold the circle in half and sew/glue inside the tortoise s mouth assembly stuff the head and pin it where you want it just under the edge of the shell you want to place in between two of the flowers in the v shape with the shell upside down stuff it you can do this lightly and add more as you begin to sew the circle on underneath if it makes it easier sew the circle around suggest starting just before the head so you can end there too sewing into the bottom of the head when you reach it too to help secure as you sew around add more filling if necessary until you are happy when the circle in fully secured add further stitches to the head to ensure it is fully secure and to adjust its position if you want to make it look up more etc making sure the legs are tightly stuffed so they can support the weight if you want"
