    "content": "rest of the foot short row this term frightens a lot of beginners but is not so difficult to master as you would think normally a short row heel and toe are identical in construction so worked the same way they start from around 50% of the sock leg or foot s total number of stitches row are knitted back and forth eliminating the end stitches in each row each time so that the row become shorter and shorter 3 however because turning in a row can cause a hole the turns are executed with a wrap and turn so the last stitch of each row gets wrapped to the next thus tightening the gaps and covering the holes when there is around one third of stitches wrapped each side of the heel or toe with about one third in the centre unwrapped the row become longer again by picking up one more stitch and wrap and knitting together each time this forms a cup shape and eventually the finish of a short row toe or heel has the same number of stitches as was started with for this section sock yarn most sock yarn is either fingering 4ply or sport but can also be double knit aran or chunky too yarn which is spun specifically for sock making often has a very small percentage of nylon added to the main fibre to make it hard wearing many years ago when there was not such a range of yarns available purely for sock knitting then sock knitters would often use nylon thread and hold it together with the main yarn to strengthen socks at heel and toe or they would at least have doubled up their yarn and knitted a hard wearing slip_stitch rib at heels or toes to reduce wear these days there is a wonderful choice of sock yarns specifically made for this purpose and most people knit socks to be luxury items rather than everyday wear however many people still swear by handmade socks and there are some budget yarns that can can make everyday socks remember as well that small holes in socks can be darned so always keep a little bit of the original sock yarn somewhere to do this sole this is the very bottom of the foot and runs out from the heel and instep it is usually distinct from the top of the foot in that it uses a smooth stockinette/stocking stitch for comfort stitch markers these are normally rings either plastic or metal and can be decorative which mark a place in a round it is useful to mark the beginning of the round at the start of knitting a sock but later can be used either side of the front of the foot to mark where the instep and/or heel should be i would not worry about spending an enormous amount on them as they often get lost anyway for someone trying out knitting in the round for the first"
