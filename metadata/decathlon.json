  "notes": "**in the spirit of the ravellenic games - and because so many people have asked here is my basic pattern for the decathlon socks :) **\r\n\r\n***each*** sock takes around 50-60g of sock yarn\r\n\r\nthe pattern is written for knitting on dpns, but also can be worked magic loop style, on two circulars or on one short circular (as i did).\r\n\r\ni used ten different colours of wollmeise twin sock yarn:\r\n\r\n**top photo l to r:** ruby thursday, tierra di sienna (discontinued), honigtopfchen (discontinued), olio vergine, schwefel, pinie, nautilus, admiral, amethyst, brombeere\r\n\r\ni have a lot of partial balls of sock yarn leftover from other projects, so worked each sock in a different colour of the rainbow. you can of course work the socks as a pair or in any colour combination that your heart desires and your stash allows. \r\n\r\nhave fun :)\r\n",
