    "content": "1 sweet bread shawl this is a shawl that i have had in mind since i started knitting brioche i wanted to design something that would be relaxing to knit and not too intimidating to the beginner something that you can melt into and have a quiet moment working on i hope i have achieved this if nothing else i hope my pattern is clear if you have any questions email me at jules@eburley com the pattern itself may not be sold but you can sell anything you make with this pattern just please give me credit as the pattern designer thank you 2 notes and materials - the sweet bread shawl is a shallow crescent shape knit in single color brioche with an icord edge knit at the same time as the body - the bind off is a simple stretchy one and the pattern after the setup row is just a one row repeat yay - you may choose any yarn/needle combination that you like for my sample i used a fingering weight sock yarn and 3 75 mm needles - have fun stash diving or use this as an excuse to go to your fave local yarn shop to splurge on that silk-merino-cashmere-unicorn blend you ve been wanting i would recommend getting at least 200 grams of yarn if not more as brioche is a yarn eater - i would recommend making a swatch or just knitting the first 10 or so row of the pattern just to see if you like the fabric you are getting i know that some of us hate swatching but you ll want to get the smooshy-gooshy-squishy fabric of brioche just right right worst case you ll have to rip out a few row but best case is you ll be on your way results may vary depending on the fiber so just keep that in mind when you go to block your piece - we always count the slipped sts with their respective yarn overs as one st so your count should always be a nice multiple of 2 - note the icord edges are always done the same way every row we knit 2 at the beginning of the row and slip 2 purlwise with the yarn in front at the end with all that out of the way we can start begin with a slipknot and cast on a total of 6 stitches i used the longtail cast on but you can use the pinhole cast on to make the beginning nice and tidy if you want 3 turning your work at the end of every row work as follows setup row 1 k2 sl1yo k1 sl2pwyif 6 setup row 2 k2 sl1yo brkinc in sl1yo from prev row sl2pwyif 8 setup row 3 k2 sl1yo k1 sl1yo brkinc sl2pwyif 10 repeat row repeat ad nauseum k2 sl1yo k1 sl1yo *brk sl1yo* repeat between the asterisks until 3 stitches remain the last sl1yo from the previous row and"
