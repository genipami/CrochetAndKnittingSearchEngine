    "content": "**level** to crochet the lilac moonchild crop top you will need beginner to lower intermediate knowledge of crocheting skills stitches used in this pattern are chain single and double_crochet **material** moonchild crop top is made from acrylic dk yarn and you use a 3 5 mm hook to crochet with it takes about 100-200 gr of yarn depending on your size the yarn is soft cotton-like breathable and almost weightless you truly forget you re wearing anything in my previous moonchild collection 1 piece - the lilac crop-top 2 i added crocheted bra pads to eliminate transparency however for this halter top additional bra pads are not necessary since the yarn is a bit heavier and the stitches are really dense **size** the top is suitable for any size and the pattern is written for sizes s-m-l-xl-2xl-3xl **how it s made step by step with love** you ll crochet this top in several stages firstly you make the left and right cups separately secondly you crochet the underbust part directly onto the bottom edges of the cups connecting them at the back with a simple chain the chain will be a foundation for the back once that s done you edge the entire piece with single_crochet stitches and delicate mesh for a soft romantic finish finally you make a long strap by twisting a long piece of yarn which you then thread through the back crisscross it then pull through the top corners of the cups and tie it around your neck for a secure fit **buttons & optional corset drawstring** the top closes at the front with buttons giving it a charming vintage feel and if the cleavage feels too deep for your comfort you can easily adjust it make a drawstring just like the straps and lace it through the chain spaces at the bottom of the cups just above the buttons this simple addition works like a corset and lets you open or close the neckline depending on your mood or outfit 1 https //www krpenalutkica com/moonchild-collection/ 2 https //www ravelry com/patterns/library/lilac-moonchild"
