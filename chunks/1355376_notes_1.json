    "content": "this cute little shoulder wrap - or shawlette - is a beginner level project that s perfect for those transitional periods between spring and summer and autumn when you just want something small and light to carry with you * this pattern uses the moss stitch also known as linen stitch each row is a repeated two-stitch sequence of a single_crochet in the chain-space of the previous row followed by a chain-1 * the shawlette is worked flat from the center of the longest edge outward to the corners the border is then worked in rounds * the pattern is written for two colors indicated as main color mc and contrast color cc the mc is a solid neutral background that allows the varying colors of the cc to pop in the sample pictured the cc consists of five mini skeins as one mini skein is completed it is replaced with the next you can opt to use one full skein of fingering weight yarn with about the same yardage approx 435yds/100g * when alternating the yarns to create the stripes it is recommended that the non-working yarn be carried along the edge rather than cut after each color change any rough transitions will be covered by the border * in general gauge may not be important on shawls and similar garments since they are not sized like clothing however if your gauge is much larger than the pattern gauge you may run out of one or both yarns before finishing the full size * this shawlette is just large enough to wrap around the shoulders with little overlap so instructions for an optional fastening loop are included this loop will help keep the shawlette in place around the shoulders without needing to tie a knot or use a pin if you would prefer a larger shawl see the customization note at the end of the pattern if you find any errors in my pattern please drop me a comment thanks"
