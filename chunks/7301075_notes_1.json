    "content": "these embroidery hoop ornaments are a quick and easy project that can be made using any scraps of 4-ply/fingering yarn- perfect as a festive stash-busting project \u2728 the knitted section is worked flat using very basic techniques and stitches to create a vague circle shape which is then stretched across a 3-inch embroidery hoop the knitted fabric is then gathered on the reverse side of the ornament stuffed lightly and backed with a circle of felt which is hand stitched on a ribbon is then strung through the top for hanging the ornament on the tree the blog post includes clear instructions for the knitted piece as well as a detailed walkthrough with photos for assembling the ornament sewing on the felt backing and adding the ribbon **gauge ** because this pattern has been designed as a stash-busting project any type of sock yarn can be used gauge will inevitably vary from yarn to yarn so i have not listed a specific gauge in the pattern ideally you just want to knit a dense enough fabric that it is not too see-through when stretched over the embroidery hoop for all of the ornaments pictured i used a 2 25mm needle but use whatever needle size you feel gives the best finish a good rule of thumb would be to use the needle size that you would use to make a pair of socks from the same yarn **materials ** * 8-10g of any sock yarn * 2 25mm needles * 3-inch embroidery hoop * felt for the backing * sewing thread in a matching colour to your felt * toy stuffing * hand sewing needle * ribbon for hanging * darning needle * scissors for more information see https //gemmaathome co uk/embroidery-hoop-ornament-pattern/"
