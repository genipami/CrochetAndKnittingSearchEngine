[www.espacetricot.com][1]\r\n\r\nthe cooler side of warm is a cozy cowl knit from the bottom up. it begins with 1x1 ribbing knit flat and then is joined to be worked in the round. as a result, it has a split-hem on one side that allows it to sit comfortably on the shoulder and lie flat against the back and chest. it is finished with 1x1 rib on a smaller needle to prevent gaping at the neck. \r\n\r\nwoolfolk far makes this functional beauty exquisitely soft and decidedly sophisticated. turn down part of the ribbing and attach a latch leather closure from jul designs to add a little attitude. :-)",
