  "notes": "the crooked coffee cozy is easy to customize to other sizes and a great stashbuster project. \r\n\r\nyou will need approximately 32 yards (29 m) of medium worsted weight yarn (we used cotton) for this project. \r\n\r\nto make your coffee cozy more snug, work until you have a finished length of 7 inches (instead of 8 inches) - so approximately 20 rows in total.\r\n\r\nto decrease the height of the coffee cup cozy, decrease the number of starting chains you use. for a 3 inch tall cozy begin with a chain of 19 (instead of 23).\r\n\r\n[video tutorial here][1]\r\n\r\nthis pattern was originally designed by danyel pink. it is now available exclusively at oombawka design crochet.\r\n\r\n> danyel pink has sold the full\r\n> copyright for this pattern and all\r\n> associated images to oombawka design,\r\n> ltd.\r\n\r\n♥ rhondda\r\ninstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oombawkadesigncrochet/\r\ninstagram reels: https://www.instagram.com/oombawkadesigncrochet/reels/\r\ntiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@oombawkadesigncrochet\r\npinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/oombawkadesigncrochet/\r\nyoutube: https://www.youtube.com/oombawkadesigncrochet\r\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/oombawkadesigncrochet/\r\nnewsletter: https://oombawkadesigncrochet.com/crochet-newsletter\r\n\r\n© 2022, oombawka design crochet. all rights reserved. you may sell finished items you crochet from this pattern. no part of this publication may be reproduced, altered, or distributed in any form, or by any means, without express written permission from rhondda mol.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://youtu.be/q2aglcsns60"
