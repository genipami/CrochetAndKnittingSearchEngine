    "content": "this is a simple triangular shawl knit in garter stitch with increases worked on the right side row at the edges and on either side of the center stitch the shawl can be knit entirely in garter stitch without the attached i-cord border the border may be knit in the same yarn as the body of the shawl or in another yarn of the same weight the amount of yarn needed for the border is fairly small so you can use up a partial skein of leftover yarn from another project because the shawl can be knit as small or as large as you like it s a good way to use up a stash of yarn that s not enough for a sweater but more than you need for a scarf or other small accessory you can simply keep knitting and increasing the length and width of your shawl until you have used up all your yarn except for the amount you will need for the bind off *many thanks to genevi\u00e8ve lemieux genuefa /people/genuefa for her generous translation of this pattern into french *"
