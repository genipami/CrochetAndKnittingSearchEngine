    "content": "this pattern will allow you to custom make a beanie to fit any head - great for those people with super huge heads any yarn is ok - however i used dk for the examples and i think the hat looks best in thinner yarns you need 2 colours of yarn - up to 200m max of the main colour and up to 50m max of the second colour for stripes less yarn in terms of length will be needed if you re making one using a thicker yarn use whatever hook the yarn recommends - normally a 4 0mm for dk the hat starts off with a magic magic_ring however there are other techniques you can use if you prefer"
