  "notes": "the trailhead bucket hat\r\n\r\nwhen you get away with your family, what goes on your packing list? hats are at the top of our packing list for our annual family camping trip. we never know when we’ll need them and would hate to be caught without one. \r\nthat’s why when i finished designing the trailhead cardigan, i decided to create a fun bucket hat to take with us on this year’s trip. this pattern features a decorative band with the same stitch pattern as the cardigan paired with a single crochet crown and brim to keep the hat moldable. \r\n\r\nfinished sizes:\r\ninstructions given to fit size x-small (toddler); changes for small (child), medium (tween), large (adult), and x-large (adult large) are in () \r\nxs (s, m, l, xl) \r\nhat circumference: 17 ½” (19”, 20 ½”, 22”, 23 ½”)\r\nbrim: 2 ¼” (2 ¼”, 2 ¾”, 2 ¾”, 2 ¾”)\r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\ni used bernat handicrafter cotton, which is a 100% cotton, #4 worsted weight yarn. \r\nany yarn of similar weight would work. \r\napproximately 140 (155, 170, 185, 200) yds. \r\n4.5mm hook\r\nstitch markers\r\nyarn needle\r\nscissors\r\nmeasuring tape\r\n\r\nskill level: \r\neasy\r\n\r\nthis pattern has been tested by a number of experienced crocheters. if you run into trouble you are free to message me for help."
