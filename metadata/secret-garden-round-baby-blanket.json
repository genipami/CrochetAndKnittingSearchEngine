  "notes": "circle blankets have such a romantic look, and this round crochet blanket pattern is no exception! it has a beautiful lacy texture made up of shells, clusters and cross stitches.\r\n\r\n*this crochet pattern is available for free (baby blanket-throw sizes) on my website or you can download all 9 sizes here as a print-optimized, ad-free pdf for your convenience.*\r\n\r\n**difficulty:**\r\nintermediate/advanced\r\n\r\n*materials needed:* \r\n6.5mm (k) hook, or hook needed to obtain gauge\r\n800, (1100, 1400, 1800, 2200, 2700, 3200, 3800, 5200) yds #4 worsted weight red heart with love in \"eggshell\", or red heart comfort in “petal pink” or the color of your choice.\r\nyarn needle\r\nscissors\r\nstitch markers in several different colors\r\n\r\n**stitches used:**\r\nch = chain\r\nsl st = slip stitch\r\nsc = single crochet\r\ndc = double crochet\r\n\r\n**additional terms:**\r\n3dc cluster = dc3tog in same stitch.\r\ncross stitch = sk st, dc in next st, cross over st just made and dc in skipped st.\r\ncross stitch increase = dc in next unworked st, cross over st just made, dc in previous st.\r\nst/sts = stitch/stitches\r\nsp/sps = space/spaces\r\n\r\n**gauge:**\r\ncircle measures 9 1/2\" across after round 9.\r\n\r\n**measurements:** \r\napproximate diameter: \r\nsmall receiving blanket: 40\"\r\nlarge receiving blanket: 46\"\r\ncrib blanket: 53\"\r\nsmall throw blanket: 60\"\r\nlarge throw blanket: 67\"\r\ntwin blanket: 74”\r\ndouble blanket: 81”\r\nqueen blanket: 88”\r\nking blanket: 102”\r\n\r\n**additional notes:**\r\n-ch 1 at beginning of round does not count as a stitch.\r\n*stitch markers are going to save you so much time and headache in this pattern, especially the ones that have alternating increases.* use them liberally. your sanity will thank you later.\r\n-as your blanket gets larger, read through the rounds first--especially the ones with the sc in the ch-4 spaces. this is where stitch markers in different colors will be very helpful. this is where the blanket gets its difficulty rating.\r\n-seriously, stitch markers in different colors for alternating increases are what you need.\r\n-having trouble getting your counts right? have you remembered stitch markers?\r\n-maintain very relaxed tension when crocheting this pattern.\r\n"
