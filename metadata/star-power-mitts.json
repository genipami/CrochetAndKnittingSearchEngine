  "notes": "great for small amounts of fingering weight wool. all you need for star power mitts is 70 yards of the main color and 74 yards of the contrasting color. \r\n\r\nthere are 3 charts in this pattern: the front of the mitt, the palm of the mitt, and the thumb gusset.\r\n\r\nthey are knitted in the round. i used standard double pointed needles. the mitt is knitted with size 2 needles and the corrugated ribbing is knitted with size 1 needles.  the thumb is gusseted for a nice fit. \r\n\r\n"
