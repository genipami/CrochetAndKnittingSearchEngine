  "notes": "**recommended supplies**\r\napprox 138(160) yds; la mia natural wool (colorway pictured: beige)\r\nus 7 circular needles, 16″\r\nus 7 double pointed needles or\r\nus 7 circular needles, 24″ or longer\r\nyarn needle\r\nscissors\r\n\r\n**pattern notes**\r\nthis simple ribbed knit hat is worked in the round starting with 16″ circular needles. you’ll be able to use these needles until you get to about round 6 of the crown decreases. at that point, the stitches will no longer stretch around the 16″ circumference, and you’ll need to switch to double pointed needles, or a 32″ circular needle (of the same 4.5mm size) to finish the crown decreases.\r\n\r\nmagic loop is our preferred method over using double-pointed needles so that’s what we demonstrate in the tutorial."
