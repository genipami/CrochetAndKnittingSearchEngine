    "content": "getting an exact gauge is not critical but will affect yarn quantities used and finished measurements granny squares are regaining popularity but i really didn t want to do more squares a ripple seemed like it would be fun but still wasn t tickling my fancy after some thought i suddenly realized that a spike stitch would make a good alternative so here we are my brother-in-law said that the colors i used made him want a guinness so i believe i ve named this pattern appropriately use whatever size yarn and hook you want make it as wide or as long as you want just have fun with it just remember that because of the spike stitch the blanket will be dense and get very heavy as it gets larger - but it is so very warm *errata 8/6/14 - row 1 correction removed all standing double_crochet instructions * *2/10/16 - updated row 3 * **hook s ** use recommended hook for selected yarn use larger size hook for a lacier version **colors & approx yardage ** ah heck just buy lots of yarn and no one will get hurt yardage given is for the sample size which is 40 x36 **notions ** yarn needle **skill level ** easy **yarn choice ** * this pattern is not suitable for eyelash or similar yarns that would obscure the spike stitch definition the spike stitch needs a yarn with little or no halo in order to look its best * the greater the contrast between yarn colors the more dramatic the spike stitch effect will be * the sample used up almost the entire skein of six of the seven colors i d chosen plus more for the one i used for the border it is sized for an infant or child so for an adult sized afghan you ll need to at least double the amount of yarn used if the yarn is worsted weight * although i used the yarn bee soft secret yarn for the sample project i would not recommend its use it had knots every few feet/yards in several skeins it splits and frays easily and knots are inconsistent some are made over all strands some over half the strands it is also slippery so slip knots tend to well slip apart other yarn bee yarns i ve used have not had this problem so don t hesitate to use them **variations ** * instead of making two row of ea color try making one or three or four * make the width one or two reps and 50-60 long for a scarf * make the width 50-60 wide and 15 long for a wrap or 15 wide and 50-60 long video on youtube for spike stitch 1 1 https //www youtube com/watch v=xhptlelqhae&index=1&list=plzfc7d2i-n5axgz31eu8oskyyhhazvmev"
