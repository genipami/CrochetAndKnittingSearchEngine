  "notes": "this basic heart starts with a magic ring and is worked in two rounds, using a variety of stitches. i think cotton works very well with this kind of pattern, but you can use any kind of yarn in any weight you like! \r\n\r\nthe pattern comes with both us and uk stitch terminology. there's a simple written version, plus a photo tutorial for you to see how the whole thing comes together.\r\n\r\ni made a ton of these hearts in different yarn weights - take a look at my [basic heart photo gallery][1] to see what your heart could look like made in thread... or super bulky!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.crochetleaf.com/basic-heart-gallery.html"
