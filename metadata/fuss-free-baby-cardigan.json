  "notes": "a simple and fuss free baby cardigan with short sleeves, ideal for a knitter who is new to seamless knitting, this tiny garment allows for lots of customisation to suit baby girls and boys alike.\r\n\r\navailable in 2 sizes 0-3months (chest size 19.5\") and 3-6 months (chest size 21\") this cute cardigan uses less than 100g of dk weight yarn.\r\n\r\nthe finished cardigan in the sample is knit in the 3-6 month size and uses approx 60-70g yarn making it ideal for stashbusting.\r\n\r\nstitch counts are given for each row in a handy table, making it easy to keep track of your increases.\r\n\r\nthe arm length is deliberately short - making this the ideal layering piece over a onesie or vest - but longer arms could easily be added if required. this link is useful as a sizing guide:\r\n[https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/baby-size-chart][1]\r\n\r\nthis pattern is provided free, however if you do download and use it i would be very grateful if you would consider making a donation to the charity bliss. this is a uk based charity doing amazing work to help babies born too young or too small. both of my boys were born premature and the unit in which they received such fabulous care was heavily supported by this and other charities. this is just my way of trying to give something back to them.\r\n\r\nthe link to the just giving donation page is:\r\nhttps://www.justgiving.com/louise-tilbrook-designs/\r\n\r\nand all proceeds will go directly to bliss.\r\n\r\neta: since writing this it has come to my attention that charitable donations made via paypal from outside the uk incur a transaction fee and so it is not possible to donate to the just giving website from outside the uk using paypal.  credit/debit card payments are fine however. if you are outside the uk and would like to show your support, but are reluctant to use your credit/debit card please consider making a donation to a local charity of your choice, or maybe use the pattern to knit something for your local baby unit and pay it forward in that way.\r\nmany thanks for your support.\r\n\r\nthank you and happy knitting!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/baby-size-chart\r\n\r\npattern support: please note that this is a pattern made freely available to all knitters and as such is not offered with pattern support."
