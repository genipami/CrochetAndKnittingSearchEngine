    "content": "of stitches in each intarsia block try to even out where you add/remove repeats so that no colour group is more than 6 pairs longer or shorter than any other group the leg can be made as tall or as short as you d like i did 50 row ending after row 12 i recommend ending after an even-numbered row and not after row 8 or 10 if the length you want would normally end after row 8 or 10 i d recommend going a little bit further to end after row 12 write down the row you ended on as you ll continue with the next row when it s time to knit the foot the heel uses two pairs of colours and i recommend picking two colour groups with the same number of stitches for the heel depending on what row you ended with and how many stitches your sock is the heel will have slightly different charts but the idea is to continue the diagonal stripes within each colour group through the heel i ll show the chart for a sock with 3 colour blocks of 18 pairs each as if you ended after row 6 10 12 16 or 20 if you stopped after a different even-numbered row you ll have to invert the colours if you re making a sock in a different size you ll have to widen or shrink the chart as appropriate we want to split the heel stitches in half between the two colour groups used for the heel in the first row you will move the cutoff between these intarsia blocks so we want the first block which will get larger after the move to start with fewer stitches if you have more or fewer stitches around your sock the heel will also change in general aim to have the flap be about 30%aslongasyoursock scircumference butbesuretoworkanevennumberofrowsintheheelflap changingthenumber ofrowswillalsochangethegussetdecreases whicharethefudgiestpartofthepattern ifyouchangethenumberofstitches the pattern will probably have some missing or extra stitches between the final gusset picked up stitch and the continuation of the leg pattern this will get hidden under the gusset decreases so it s not a big issue during the decreases avoid reaching row 12 of the leg chart because we might have to use it to hide some sins if numbers don t work out perfectly even-numbered row will always be matching the colours that you see and odd-numbered row will shift the colours over by one column if you would reach row 12 for the instep instead work row 8 if things don t look quite right after you finish the gusset decreases use the inversion between row 11 and 12 to get back to the regular pattern end the foot after an even-numbered row if the final row is 4 6 8 or 10 invert the colours of that final row if you added or removed pattern repeats you ll have to chart your own toe decreases i recommend first doing decreases in just the larger"
