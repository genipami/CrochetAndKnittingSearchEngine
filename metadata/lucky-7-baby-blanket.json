  "notes": "crochet lucky 7 baby blanket is an easy filet, from the middle blanket that works up easily, perfect for those spring and summer newborns.\r\n\r\ni used bernat® bundle up™ yarn for this lovely blanket.  it is oeko-tex® certified, and are tested for over 300 harmful substances, so great for your baby’s sensitive skin. this pattern would crochet up nicely with any yarn, so don’t feel limited.  just match your hook size to your yarn and you’ll be good to go.\r\n\r\ni call this lucky 7 because you will find yourself counting to 7 over and over. it has an easy 4 round repeat that grows a bit each round.  don’t let the 3 page pdf scare you.  after the 12th round, most will see the repeat and not need the pattern.  i do like to include stitch counts when i can for those that prefer to check their work."
