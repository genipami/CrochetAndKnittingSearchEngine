    "content": "this blanket has been inspired by the character ross poldark from bbc s poldark 2015 i used ross s colour palette and incorporated various themes including crossroads and breaking barriers into each square gauge is not essential for this project as a guide the big central square turned out roughly 16 inches for me worked in dk with a 4 5mm hook the smallest squares were 4 inches the medium squares 8 inches if your central square is smaller your blanket will be correspondingly smaller if your square is bigger your blanket will be bigger use what feels comfortable to you with the yarn you choose i tend to have a tight gauge use your own judgement as to whether you want to go up or down a hook size or even two there are two pattern documents one with plenty of images to help with particular steps or stitches and one without images which is smaller and more printer-friendly please note that the centre square has been tested by others but the other patterns have only been tested by me updated 9th february 2017 i m pleased to say that the pattern is now available in dutch and also as a stitch diagram thanks to the lovely sannemethorst 1 1 http //www ravelry com/people/sannemethorst"
