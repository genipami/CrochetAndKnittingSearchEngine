  "notes": "this design features a beautiful chevron lace stitch that reminds me of cute little owls (“chouette” means owl in french)! the pattern may look intimidating, but it’s simple to work and easy to memorize. it has beautiful drape and is breathable, but still cozy, making it the perfect piece to wear as winter slowly transitions to spring. for the complete set, make sure to check out the matching [chouette hat][1] pattern in my ravelry shop!\r\n\r\ni went stash diving for this project and ended up using our back 40 alpaca yarn in a beautiful chestnut brown color. the listed weight is worsted, but it’s on the lighter side, so i recommend using dk instead. however, the weight difference between dk and worsted is slight, so feel free to use worsted if that’s what you have on hand!\r\n\r\n\r\n***materials***\r\n\r\napproximately 250 yards (228 m) of a dk (3) or worsted (4) weight yarn.\r\n\r\nus size 4 (3.5mm) 16” circular knitting needles, or size needed to obtain gauge.\r\n\r\ncommon notions, such as stitch markers, measuring tape, yarn needle, and scissors.\r\n\r\n\r\n***measurements***\r\n\r\napproximately 10” tall and 26” around.\r\n\r\n\r\n***gauge***\r\n\r\n20 sts x 33 rows = 4” in main stitch pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n***disclaimer***\r\n\r\nyou are more than welcome to sell anything you make using this pattern; i just ask that you credit me as the designer. you may not claim this pattern as your own, and you may not sell or distribute its contents in any form. if you have any questions, you can reach me by email at thechesapeakeneedle@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n***sharing***\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy this knitting pattern! also, i’d love to see your work! tag me in your photos on instagram using @thechesapeakeneedle, #thechesapeakeneedle, and #chouettecowl so that i can find you easily! i just might share your photos on my page. see you there!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/chouette-hat\r\n  [2]: http://eepurl.com/dnmt1r\r\n  [3]: https://www.instagram.com/thechesapeakeneedle\r\n  [4]: https://www.pinterest.com/thechesapeakeneedle\r\n  [5]: https://www.ravelry.com/designers/lindsey-faciane\r\n  [6]: https://www.instagram.com/thechesapeakeneedle",
