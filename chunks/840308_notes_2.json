    "content": "on the skein if you have any doubts -to create a striped cover or hot pad join the second color after round 3 and change color every 2 stitches i switched colors by pulling the new color through the center of the half_double_crochet stitch you may need to go up to a 5mm or larger hook when doing things this way as it is easy to tighten your gauge if you are not familiar with the fair isle crochet technique -if you decide to use two colors you may want to go up a hook size or two as it s easy to tighten up your gauge when changing color every 2 stitches -this is a very versatile piece and can be adjusted to make not only various sizes of hot pads or potholders but also small bags and coin purses glasses/phone cases and even decorative pillows leave the top open for bags purses and cases -fun fact this is what the crunch stitch looks like worked in rounds instead of row"
