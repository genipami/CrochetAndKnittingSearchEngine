  "notes": "bunny desk buddy loves to accompany you and cheer you on as you work hard! desk bunny is always ready to hold your pens, pencils, crochet hooks—whatever you need.\r\n\r\nskill level: advanced beginner\r\n\r\nthis no-sew, no-stuffing needed pattern is written in u.s. crochet terms, complete with clear instructions, pictures, and video tutorial to help you along the way. desk bunny is crocheted in the round/continuous spirals without joining the rounds. i suggest using a stitch marker or different color yarn to keep track of each round. desk bunny is crocheted in super bulky chenille yarn and is approximately 3 inches tall including top of the ear (2 inches to top of cup). be aware that size may vary depending on the yarn and hook size used. gauge is not particularly important, just be consistent with the tension you are using. and most importantly, have fun!"
