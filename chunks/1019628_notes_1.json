    "content": "this simplistic headband made with seed stitch will become a staple to your market prep this has been one of my best selling items primarily because of the simplicity and the ability to have a lower price point so i thought i would share with you how to make it it is simple enough to make and once you get the hang of it you can manipulate the pattern as you see fit techniques to know knit purl cast on work in the round bind off gauge it is not crucial for this project but if you find the end product to be a bit to big or small then it is best to size up or down based on the sizing chart included in pattern sizes there are 8 sizes available in the pattern going from 0months to adult+ yarn amounts amount of yarn required varies depending on what size you are doing and what yarn you are using you will not require more than 1 ball/skein for any of the sizes listed you will probably be able to get 2-3 headbands from one wool-ease ball fit the fit of the headband is designed to be very fitted as it will stretch with wear so if you make it put it on and it feels a smidge tight - give it a couple wears pleas be aware that this is a free pattern and has not been sent to any pattern testers so be easy on me and if you note any problems or discrepancies don t hesitate to reach out to me"
