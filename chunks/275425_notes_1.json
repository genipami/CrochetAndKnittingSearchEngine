    "content": "this pattern was edited on 3/22/12 to correct problems with stitch counts i wanted to knit a donkey for this nativity and couldn t find a pattern i was happy with so i decided i d try using what i had learned about shaping while knitting the figures in jean greenhowe s christmas crib i am absolutely delighted with how she turned out and thought i d share the pattern unlike the figures in the christmas crib this pattern is worked in the round and except for the ears is completely seamless this makes knitting and stuffing a bit more complicated but i think the result is worth the extra effort i am assuming that you have knitted in the round on dpns before and can move stitches from one needle to the other if two stitches of a decrease are on adjacent needles or the distribution of stitches becomes awkward the donkey is worked from nose to tail with no seams live stitches for the legs are held on safety pins stitches for legs are picked up and the legs are also worked in the round i have used paired lifted increases and paired decreases for symmetry and to make them less obvious links to tutorials are provided"
