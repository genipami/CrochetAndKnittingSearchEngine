    "content": "inspired by the purl soho bandana cowl i wanted a similar style but not as bulky to wear indoors the pattern was developed using the gistyarn com italian silk noil yarn but could be knit with virtually any fingering weight yarn as well i was able to knit 2 cowls from one hank of the gist yarn italian silk noil if your gauge is a bit larger your cowl will just be a bit looser i would not recommend a tighter gauge i tend to knit loosely if you cannot achieve gauge with a size 4 needle you may want to try a size 5 the pattern includes a link to and credit for the inspiration pattern from purl soho with chunky yarn"
