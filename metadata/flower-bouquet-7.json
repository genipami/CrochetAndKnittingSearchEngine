  "notes": "this is my contribution to the bamcal 2025 and an homage to early spring flowers.\r\n\r\ni combined different flowers for you: lesser celandine, daisy, tulip, dandelion. flowers that mean spring for me. the result is a big new flower. or, if you want to say so- a flower bouquet.\r\n\r\ni did not use the original colours, as in the bamcal we all use our unique ones. so feel free to use whatever you want. if you want to use the colours the plants really have: lesser celandine is yellow, daisy white and yellow, tulip exists in many ways and dandelion seeds are light brown. but it's not necessary at all. the only thing you have to take care is not to fo when i say so, as some effects need more than one round.\r\n\r\nthe pattern contains 22 rounds, which is quite a big amount, and it looks very complex. but please don't fear- most of the time i used basic stitches and many of the rounds are so easy and repetet that i even decided not to provide a stitch count in these rounds.\r\n\r\npattern uses u.s. terms\r\n\r\npdf can be found here: [flower bouquet][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://padlet.com/alexandrazaminer1/crochet-patterns-ayn4uaegwde4a7oo"
