  "notes": "these simple socks are an easy introduction for new sock knitters, or a quick and chunky bed sock for those that know what they are doing.\r\n\r\nthe socks are worked from the toe up using circular needles and magic loop, and have a german short row heel. there may be some new techniques that you will need to look up, but they will be a great addition to your knitting toolkit!\r\n\r\n**sizes**\r\neur size 36 (38, 40) or 22.5 (24, 25) cm. or whatever length you like!\r\n\r\n**yarn**\r\napproximately 60g-100g of 8ply yarn. (our sample fits a size 41 and weighs 80g per pair)\r\nwe used a mix of millpost merino, woolganics, and white gum wool yarns, but any 8ply yarn would be fine.\r\n\r\n**needles**\r\n3.25-3.50mm 80cm circular needles, depending on your gauge.\r\noptional, 80cm circular needle 1 or 2 sizes smaller for tighter ribbing.",
