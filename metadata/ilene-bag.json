  "notes": "this is a very stretchy bag, with a comfortable wide strap that won’t dig into your shoulder when you’ve got a big load of fruit or yarn or rocks.  the yarn is machine washable and dryable, so if a tomato squishes it’s no big deal.  the strap isn’t very long, which is intentional because i don’t like stretched out straps that leave the bottom of the bag dangling by my knees.  if you want a longer strap, plan on more yarn, or else do fewer repeats of the mesh pattern before working the ribbing.  if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.",
