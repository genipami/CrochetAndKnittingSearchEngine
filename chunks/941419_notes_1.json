    "content": "this is a very simple hat made more interesting with two latvian braids and corrugated ribbing the pattern was written to support a latvian braid class at hands on knitting center you need approximately 130 yards of the mc and about 50 yards of the cc with two skeins of alegria grande you can get two hats if you change mc/cc for the second hat i love mixing a variegated and tonal yarn for this hat but if you really want to see the braid clearly use two tonal or solid yarns with really good contrast"
