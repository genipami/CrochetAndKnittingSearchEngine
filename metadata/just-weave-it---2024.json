  "notes": "designed for the 2024 games, this pattern is based on \"**french weave**\", a fun easy-to-work stitch, perfect for working while watching the action. \r\n\r\nevery time the games are on i make some patterns especially for the games - you can find more info about other patterns - [here][1]\r\n\r\nwritten for dk weight yarn, but you can adjust to use other weights if you like\r\n\r\nallow approx. 100m/110yds each of 2 yarns for a single loop\r\nallow approx. 200m/220yds each of 2 yarns for a double loop \r\n\r\nfor the contrast colour you can use variegated or striping yarn for interesting effects. \r\nfor the main colour you can use light or dark yarn; solid, or even another variegated or striping yarn, just make sure you have good contrast between all the colours in the yarns. \r\n\r\nthe cowl is worked as a strip, starting with a provisional cast-on and then kitchenered/grafted together for a seamless finish. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/discuss/stitchnerds/4321577/1-25#1",
