    "content": "you really can use any type of yarn for this project however i used four and half balls of a self-striping 50% wool 50% acrylic yarn called ice colourway in lilac shades the total yardage is 400m plus the cast off yarn i m treating the two separately as i used an i-cord cast off which looks really super in a different colour from your project so this is a good way to add colour if you are using one coloured yarn the i-cord also adds a nice three-dimensional cast off which is lovely for little fingers to hold on to the diameter of the finished blanket is just over 80cm which is perfect for outings in the summer obviously if you want a larger blanket just carry on knitting ~~quoted from website"
