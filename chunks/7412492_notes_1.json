    "content": "these crochet feathers work up quickly and provide a great way to use small amounts of yarn you re likely to be left with after putting your advent calendar to use use any color you want pair 2-3 scraps experiment with stripes whatever you do it s going to be beautiful consider using them individually as keychains bookmarks etc include them along with tassels on the ends of a scarf or shawl or join lots them together for a full project made of feathers i d love to see your creations you ll follow the same pattern for either dk or sock weight yarn with dk obviously resulting in a larger feather gauge is not important below is my hook recommendation but choose what feels right to you yardage varies but the maximum you should need for a single feather if worked as the large version is 25 yds the pattern is the same for both yarn weights but you re able to choose a small or large version both versions begin the same but where the small feather begins decreasing you ll continue another increase section for the large version"
