  "notes": "this hat used to be free! if you would like to support me and pay full price, that is much appreciated :) if you would like to support me a little bit but still get a sweet deal and pay half price, use code **halfjoy**. if you would like it for free, use code **freejoy**.\r\n\r\na lovely hat i designed for my friend joy, who requested a soft squashy cap to keep her head warm this winter.\r\n\r\nthis pattern has been updated 01/2022!\r\n \r\nthis hat features twisty intertwined cables interspersed between panels of moss stitch. one size fits most.\r\n\r\n200 yds of dk yarn should be sufficient. \r\n\r\nedit 01/06/2021: prettified the pattern and did some small tweaks. anybody who uses new pattern please give feedback!\r\n\r\nedit 01/21/2021: fixed errata in pattern, row 10 st 22 should be purl, row 17 sts 15-16 should be purl"
