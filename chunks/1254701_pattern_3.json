    "content": "for example my shoulder to wrist measurement was 20 which would suggest using 5 of my 4 squares however i only needed 4 squares to achieve the right length work out how many squares you will need to make your sleeves 2-5 shorter than your shoulder to wrist measurement this is sleeve length page 4 recipe for a granny square cardigan by insertinnergeek designs shoulder to hem -5 /square size rounded up to next integer e g 20-5 /4 = 3 75 therefore sleeve length is 4 squares the sleeves will also need to fit around the arms you will want the number of squares that will most closely match the upper arm measurement but without restricting movement in my case 4 squares gave me exactly the circumference i needed work out the smallest number of squares that will give you at least the upper arm measurement this is the sleeve circumference upper arm/square size rounded up to next integer e g 16/4 = 4 therefore sleeve circumference is 4 squares each sleeve will need a total number of square given by the sleeve length multiplied by the sleeve circumference in my case this was 4 squares by 4 squares so each sleeve used 16 squares sleeve length x sleeve circumference = sleeve squares e g 4 x 4 = 16 squares hood the hood has to be fitted to the size of the neck opening which in turn depends on the widths of the front and back panels the neck opening is created by seaming across the shoulder at the top of the front and back panels leaving a gap in the middle the gap needs to be about 8-10 across which will be about 2 squares for 4-5 squares or can be calculated by 9/ squares size rounded to the nearest integer e g 9/4 = 2 25 therefore the gap is 2 squares the shoulder seam will be seamed across back panel width - gap /2 squares seaming across half a square is ok back panel width - gap /2 squares no rounding required e g 5-2 /2 = 1 5 therefore each should seam is worked across 1 and a half squares the hood is then attached across the remaining squares at the top of the back and front panels work out the total number of squares from two times the front panel width plus the back panel width and take away 4 times the shoulder seam this is the hood width page 5 recipe for a granny square cardigan by insertinnergeek designs 2 x front panel width + back panel width - 4 x shoulder seam e g 2 x 3 + 5 - 4 x 1 5 = 6 + 5 - 6 = 5 therefore the hood width is 5 squares the hood height needs to be at least half the hood measurement bigger is better work out the hood measurement divided by the square size and divide by two then round up"
