    "content": "i created this pattern while knitting a nother pair of plain vanilla socks in self-striping yarn i wanted something a little different but equally mindless and this technique fit the bill this pattern is really more of a recipe- it assumes that you have experience knitting socks and does not have instructions for any particular toe or heel it is written for toe up socks on two circulars but could easily be modified for top down and/or magic loop any weight of self-striping yarn will work if you adjust your stitch count and needle size you could also use leftover yarn to make your own stripes"
