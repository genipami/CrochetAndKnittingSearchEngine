    "content": "this lightweight lace shawl is an unusual arrow head shape allowing it to sit well over the shoulders and back crocheted from the centre top down it is perfect for those on a tight yarn budget or if you are using a gradient yarn gauge is not critical for this project - just choose your preferred hook for your yarn and keep crocheting until your shawl has reached your desired size it looks complex but is actually an easy two row repeat for the main stitch pattern charts for the main stitch pattern and edging are included i hope you enjoy this pattern"
