  "notes": "**note from bev:**\r\ni absolutely love this pattern... makes up quickly and it really works.\r\ni received one made with kitchen cotton and love it!\r\n\r\nthis potholder looks really odd and turns in on itself, but eventually it will form a square that you can whipstitch together at the open seam! \r\n\r\noriginal design by marion roggow, of athens, michigan."
