    "content": "frankie s knitted stuff ten stitch baby hats following on from my adult ten stitch hat this pattern is for two different sizes of baby hats they are both knitted in thin 4 ply yarn using 2 75 mm / us size 2 needles as the hats are knitted in a continuous ten stitch wide strip it s difficult to make many sizes other than by changing the weight of the yarn luckily babies come in all sizes and they grow so they could start off with the small hat and then the big one will fit them eventually as babies heads are big in proportion to their bodies i suspect that the bigger of these hats will fit them for some time the crown to brim measurements in the table below were taken with the brim unfolded folding it up takes off about 3 cm / 1\u00bc circumference crown to brim yarn big hat 38 cm / 15 16 5 cm / 6\u00bd 30g small hat 30 cm / 12 12 5 cm / 5 20g 1 the big hat i ll start with the bigger hat as that is simplest especially if you are familiar with the adult hat pattern the yarn i used for this one was king cole zigzag 420 m / 100g shade 4810 bumble bee gauge isn t vital but using 2 75 mm needles my ten stitch strip of garter stitch was about 3 cm / 1\u00bc wide first some notes about techniques used in this pattern for those who are unfamiliar with my other ten stitch patterns you can refer back to these as needed things you need to know throughout this pattern i refer to ridges rather than row a \ufffd ridge in garter stitch is two knit row where possible all outside first stitches are slipped knitwise to \ufffd help with the joining i haven t put this in the instructions so as to simplify them and it s not disastrous if you forget the ten stitch strip being knitted is joined on to the body of the \ufffd knitting as you go along thus avoiding any sewing up this is done by working joining ridges like this k9 slip next stitch knitwise pick up and knit one stitch from the edge of the next ridge on the knitting or just in from the edge pass the slipped stitch over now turn and knit all 10 stitches to complete the ridge shaping is achieved by working short row / ridges knit the \ufffd specified number of stitches then wrap the following stitch turn the work and knit back this wrapping and turning will be abbreviated as w&t in the pattern and is worked like this bring the yarn forward slip the next stitch purlwise take the yarn back again replace the slipped stitch on the left hand needle bring the yarn forward again and turn the work because of all the turning it s best to knit the hats on"
