    "content": "this is a quick cowl made from super bulky yarn it s ideal for spring or fall weather because it has little windows that keep your neck from getting too hot note don t worry if your cowl seems a little stiff i wanted one that would stay up on my neck fun fact i tested this pattern on my rat by making him a tiny pink cowl he was not amused"
