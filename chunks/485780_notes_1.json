    "content": "after searching for the perfect pattern for fingerless mittens for a choosy recipient i ended up making my own pattern the features of this pattern are 1 it is ribbed making it a good fit for a variety of sizes- the elasticity of the texture makes getting a perfect fit a breeze 2 while the mitten is ribbed the thumb is not- the thumb is sleek and fitted and stylish 3 the thumb is gusseted and the gusset is formed by adding increases between the first column of ribbing sts making for a very attractive gusset- pictures of this feature can be seen in the pattern pictures my samples used around 110 yds of yarn meaning that you can easily get two pairs from a skein of yarn that has 240 or 250 yards stitch gauge is a little difficult to determine due to the ribbed texture row gauge is 15 1/2 row in 2 instructions are included for making it a variety of sizes- it is easily adaptable the size as written is for a women s size s-m if knitting it for a teen i would knit it as written as well"
