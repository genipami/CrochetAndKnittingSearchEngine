    "content": "there have been a handful of questions on how to work the included chart because it has some squares denoted as no stitch this is a common method in charting where there are not the same number of stitches in each row when looking at the chart for the pattern you will notice that there is no stitch where decreases are worked the stitch that used to be there is no longer there because it was decreased away hence no stitch it keeps the chart tidy so that stitches are lined up where they are worked when you come to a no stitch square skip over it to the next square as for the yellow squares these are also no stitch squares but they are only omitted on the last repeat of a row the reason for omitting those stitches is so that the repeats are staggered which is what creates the staggered stitch pattern if you follow the chart exactly skip over the no stitch squares start your next round immediately instead of knitting the yellow stitches at the end of your row and move your marker to denote the new beginning of the round the new round will start just before the yellow stitches - it will work"
