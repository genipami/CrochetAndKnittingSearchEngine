    "content": "this is a very simple beginner pattern for a balaclava which is easily adjusted it involves simple knit and purl stitches with few decreases to keep count of for this pattern one 100g skein of light worsted yarn and 2-3 skeins of 25g mohair were used to produce the final project i have knit this hood for people in colder and warmer climates for example my mother in northern sweden got a hood for christmas and for the hood more useful in minus 20 degrees celsius i used a much thicker mohair meanwhile a friend who lives in southern germany also wanted one but the climate wasn t so cold so i left out the mohair altogether this being said you can adjust the yarn you would like to use depending upon the climate you want to use it in i hope you enjoy"
