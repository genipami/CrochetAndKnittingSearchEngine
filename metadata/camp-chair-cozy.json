  "notes": "there’s something about sitting in a circle with friends, chatting and crocheting away. whether we’re watching a campfire or a sporting event, i know i can always use more pockets or compartments for storing my phone, beverage, yarn, and crochet tools like hooks and yarn needles, etc. \r\n\r\nenter the camping chair cozy pattern in two sizes! the small size holds your phone and a can of pop or beer, and the larger size holds a full skein of yarn and your tools."
