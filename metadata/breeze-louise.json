  "notes": "many moons ago, while on a weekend trip with my yarn husband, i decided that i needed a new cowl. as every yarn obsessed knitter does, i popped into the local yarn shop and picked out a gorgeous skein of worsted weight yarn. they wound it and i immediately cast on something simple. by the end of the weekend i had a lovely new souvenir. a few years later i opened my own lys and re-knit the cowl in a beautiful skein of malabrigo rios. i typed up the simple pattern and gave it to customers to enjoy.  in a computer fiasco the pattern was lost . knitters, however, are not that easily defeated and so i reached for a skein of my own daughter's gorgeous hand-dyed wool and recreated it, this time  playing with different needle sizes and cast on amounts until i felt it was  just right. the pattern is simple and i'm sure others have surely knitted it before without a pattern as i did in my early years of knitting, but worth recording none-the-less.  i hope you enjoy it as i have! \r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\n1 skein emma's yarn washable worsted wool, 100% superwash merino 218 yards/ 100g (pictured in glamping) or 210 yards of a worsted weight yarn. \r\n\r\n1 stitch marker.\r\n\r\nus size 9 (5.5 mm) 24 inch \r\ncircular needle.\r\n\r\ndarning needle for weaving in ends.\r\n\r\ngauge: \r\n12.5 sts and 16 rows = 4 in blocked, in stitch pattern. \r\ngauge is not terribly important for this project as long as you like the fabric.\r\n\r\nfinished measurements:\r\n12 inches x 32 inches ",
