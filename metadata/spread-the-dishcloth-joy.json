  "notes": "for the first couple of years that i crocheted i hated making dishcloths. i thought they were boring…i found cotton hard on my hands…i felt like they took too long to make without much reward…i avoided making them. but then i found a stitch pattern that i liked and a cotton yarn that i loved, and now i’m hardly ever without a stash of colourful dishcloths! \r\n\r\ni think the biggest reason why i’m so happy to make them is because giving them away brings me so much joy. dishcloths are the perfect little gift for so many sentiments. “thank you…i appreciate you…congrats on your new place…i’m thinking of you…just because.” \r\n\r\nso anyway here is how i make them! i hope this pattern will help you spread the dishcloth joy! \r\n\r\ni use willow yarns sudsy, but use your favourite worsted or even light worsted weight cotton yarn! finished size may vary, but the pattern will tell you how to adjust to end up with whatever size you like.",
