    "content": "for stages 1 and 3 is set at 12 because of the toe shaping but you have some flexibility in how many row you work during stage 2 checkpoint 1 gives you an indicator of whether or not you will need to make adjustments to your row count later on \uf0b7 on-target if your fabric width is anywhere between 2 1/8 and 2 3/8 you re within the target range of 2 1/4 inches there s a good chance you won t need to make any adjustments to your overall row count during stage 2 \uf0b7 off-target if your fabric is 1/4 inch larger or smaller than the target 2 1/4 inches \u2020 you will have to make adjustments during stage 2 since stage 3 is exactly the same size as stage 1 you should adjust stage 2 accordingly to compensate for the difference so take note of how much you diverge here and come back to it at checkpoint 2 checkpoint 2 is your last opportunity to adjust your row count to get the right fabric width for you it s a good idea to put in a lifeline here so that in case your fabric is not the right width at checkpoint 3 you can easily come back to checkpoint 2 and re-adjust \uf0b7 on-target if you were on target at checkpoint 1 and still on target at checkpoint 2 then no adjustments to row count are needed you re good to go through the end of stage 4 \uf0b7 off-target if you were on target at checkpoint 1 but off target by 1/4 at checkpoint 2 adjust your row count up or down until your fabric at checkpoint 2 is the target width \uf0b7 way off target if you were off target at checkpoint 1 then stage 2 will have to adjust for this difference plus the difference that will happen in stage 3 for example if stage 1 was 1/4 too wide stage 3 is also going to be 1/4 too wide hence you should work stage 2 to 1/4 inch below the checkpoint 2 target note that an adjustment of this size may bump you out of the range at which the stitch count diagrams apply to your work if this is the case follow the line-by-line instructions during stage 3 but disregard the stitch counts checkpoint 3 is a spot-check to see whether or not your sock will fit proceed to stage 4 or not rip back to checkpoint 2 \uf0b7 on-target if your fabric is within 1/8 inch of the target width proceed to stage 4 \uf0b7 off-target if your fabric is off-target by 1/4 you can probably get away with this but your sock won t be the best fit if it s off-target by 3/8 or more i definitely recommend ripping back to checkpoint 2 and re-adjusting your row count accordingly \u2020 if your fabric is smaller than 2 inches or larger than 2 1/4 inches at checkpoint 1 i highly"
