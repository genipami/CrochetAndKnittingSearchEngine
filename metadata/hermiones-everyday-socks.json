  "notes": "hermione, as described in j.k. rowling’s harry potter series, is a rather smart and practical heroine.   while she can dress up with the best of them, these socks remind me of something she might wear while practicing charms or transfiguration or reading up on arithromancy in the gryffindor common room. \r\n\r\nthis sock is knit from the cuff down and features a garter stitch edged slip stitch heel.  the pattern itself is written for one size, but with a 4 stitch pattern repeat, it is easily customizable to fit whatever size one desires. \r\n\r\n**note:  when knitting the heel flap, you begin on a ws row.**\r\n\r\n06/27/11: pattern now available for download in german :d - [patricia][1] was kind enough to provide a translation!\r\n\r\n7/30/12:  pattern now available for download in french :d jennifer, [nylwenn][2], was kind enough to provide a translation!\r\n\r\n6/24/15:  pattern now available for download in swedish!!!  thank you annicka, [madebyseven](/people/madebyseven), for providing a translation!  :)\r\n\r\n9/23/15: pattern now available for download in italian :)  thank you marina carelli, [bricci][3] for providing a translation!!\r\n\r\n1/3/17: pattern now available for download in danish :)  thank you marianne, [marianneho](/people/marianneho) for providing a translation!!\r\n\r\n3/22/21:  pattern now available for download in spanish :)  thank you geila, [geilajauregui](/people/geilajauregui) for providing a translation!!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/people/namia\r\n  [2]: http://www.ravelry.com/people/nylwenn\r\n  [3]: http://www.ravelry.com/people/bricci"
