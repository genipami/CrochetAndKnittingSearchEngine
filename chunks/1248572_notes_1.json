    "content": "this is a pattern for a quick easy and rather adorable chibi spider-man he s made in only two pieces and uses very beginner-level stitches although it s also important to know how to switch between colors smoothly he stands about 5 to 6 inches tall using the yarn and hook i recommend but you could easily make a very tiny version with a smaller yarn and hook combination you ll need less than 40g of blue yarn and red yarn a very small amount of black yarn some white and black felt a 4mm crochet hook a yarn needle scissors stuffing and a hot glue in order to make him what he s not a pok\u00e9mon it s true--i ve been doing a pok\u00e9mon series for a while now but i had a student win a grand prize and their request was a spiderman softie so i had to oblige i looked at other free patterns but they were all too big or time consuming so i ended up making my own and i also ended up liking it well enough to post the pattern that being said-- the overall construction is inspired by the bigger and chibi-er design by the very talented stuffinstitchesbycc if you like this design but want to scale it up please check out her pattern on yt or insta -- it s an excellent pattern i hope you enjoy"
