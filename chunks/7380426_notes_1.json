    "content": "this sweater is really fun because it can be made in any yarn and hook and any size as you might have noticed from the photo above is that i made 2 versions of this sweater one a cropped version with shorter sleeves and a folded ribbed collar the purple one and one much more oversized with longer sleeves and a turtleneck the pink one you can really play around with the size you can make it as big or as small as long or as short as you want its up to you and your preferences materials yarn you can use any yarn you like because this sweater is so very customizable but if you want a sweater most similar to mine i used 4 & 1/2 skeins/approx 230g for the pink sweater the longer version and 3 & 1/3 skeins/approx 173g for the purple sweater the cropped version yarn i used similar cheaper alternative hook again you can use whatever crochet hook you desire i used a very large hook but if you are not into the mesh-y look you can totally size down crochet hook i used 15 mm scissors nice and sharp darning needle my faves make seaming and weaving in ends so much easier because of the bent tip stitch markers the best they stay in place so you don t have to worry about them falling out pattern notes *this pattern follows us crochet terms *the size of the sweater i am making is very oversized for me i m a size xs/s and the sweater is approx a size l/xl so if you are my size or even a size or so up this sweater should fit you just fine depending on the look you re going for e g oversized or fitted *this pattern can be made into any size but with that being said i cannot give approx yardage/grams that you will need because it is completely customizable to you and how short wide etc you want it *in the video tutorial made in companion with this written pattern instead of working a chain 2 after i turn my work i work a foundation turning chain method linked below because it like how it makes the edges of my work look straighter and cleaner but with that being said you do not have to do this its just personal preference a chain 2 will work just fine *if you are working a chain 2 after you turn your work each row it does not count as your first stitch in this pattern *if you are working a foundation turning chain method linked below after you turn your work each row it does count as your first stitch"
