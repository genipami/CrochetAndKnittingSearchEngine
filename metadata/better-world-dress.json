  "notes": "edit: graphical and written pattern added (2pdfs)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe pattern is free. and there is a but. the moment the maker wants to show the finished dress on social media, i am asking them to choose a cause close to their heart, donate some money to that cause (any money, even 1$) and… brag about helping under the picture of the finished dress. why? because i truly believe that supporting good causes should be popular or „fashionable\". the more we brag about it, the more people should want to do it. and now, maybe i will sound controversial: even if some people help others only because it's popular, only to boost their status and personal image, or only because the maker of the pattern asked them to do it, the result is clear - those in need still get the needed resources and this could still change the world for the better, regardless of the motivation!\r\nwouldn’t it be great if showing off helping others was exactly like showing off a new designer bag? let's make it a fashion statement! i will start, with this dress.\r\n\r\nwhat you need:\r\n\r\nfingering/3 or 4ply yarn. use natural yarns (cotton, merino - pure acrylic will not work as it does not block properly) the length you need is extremely tricky to estimate - testers used from 1600m up to 2400m - this all depends on how much tension \r\nyou use. i recommend using minimum tension - dress turns out to be “flowing”, it grows really fast and you will use less yarn to finish. \r\nboth of my dresses i finished with 1800m. \r\n\r\ncrochet hook at least 3,5mm.
