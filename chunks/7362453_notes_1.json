    "content": "the three hats in this pattern are sized to fit mini american girl and lori dolls they may fit other similarly sized dolls as well i listed gauge but i am considering the first two rounds to be the gauge test they should measure 1 across to make sure the hats fit the hats are made either with size 3 crochet cotton or with two strands of #10 cotton held together think of these as hat blanks you can add trim to your heart s content i ve started having fun embelishing them as in the second photo pattern link and mods in my project page 1 another thought about crocheted doll hats they require shaping on the doll s head or what i think of as zhuzhing i ve seen hats that i have made my grandsweeties plopped on the doll s head and looking like a dish rag after a bit of tweaking and pushing into shape they look very stylish if you re still on the fence about how zhushing can affect a doll hat check out the photos on this project page 2 and just to prove how opinionated i am most hats are meant to be worn pushed down on the head not sitting high on top i have recently discovered that depending on the doll s hair this may be completely impossible that hat will just want to pop right up on top check out this project page 3 for the solution another discovery regarding how the hats fit especially on the dolls with fluffy hair is to add a removeable ribbon hat band it s a simple fix and having several different ones can really change up the look of one hat see this project 4 for details do consider the optional crab stitch edging there are lots of tutorials online and i ve seen one for forward crab stitch but haven t tried it the stitch is a bit hard to learn but makes a wonderful finish on doll hats especially ones with a brim it not only looks good but helps them to hold their shape this pattern is free but if you want to say thank you please create a project page here on ravelry 1 https //www ravelry com/projects/crazyquilter/hats-for-mini-ag-and-lori-dolls-7 2 https //www ravelry com/projects/crazyquilter/heathered-flat-top-wide-brim-hat-for-ag-mini-dolls 3 https //www ravelry com/projects/crazyquilter/hats-for-mini-ag-and-lori-dolls-3 4 https //www ravelry com/projects/crazyquilter/hats-for-mini-ag-and-lori-dolls-9"
