    "content": "this pattern is a photo guide for a crochet bonnet the stitch used is an adapted shell which is a two row repeat including one teardrop row and one arch row the piece is initially worked in the round turning the work after each row then worked flat ties are added afterwards - these can be the recommended foundation single_crochet or whatever you d like the pattern can be modified to be a more full coverage bonnet by adding an extra row after the final step to size down to a child or baby bonnet i would recommend reducing the hook and yarn size accordingly the yarn used in the guide is lana gatto merinocot which is dk weight but i have also made the bonnet in fingering weight qing fibre yak with plenty of success i used around 30-40g depending on the length of the ties use whatever you feel - but i d recommend sticking to a weight between fingering and dk the guide requires a bit of diy attitude reflecting the free nature of the pattern i hope that you have fun and put your own twist on it you re more than welcome to message me on insta for support but again as this is a free pattern i hope that you can try to figure things out by yourself enjoy"
