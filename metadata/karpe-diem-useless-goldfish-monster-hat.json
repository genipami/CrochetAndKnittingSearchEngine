  "notes": "note: this pattern is offered as is. thank you all for the comments pointing out corrections, but i will not be updating this pattern as i'm really bad at counting. also, like edna mode, \"i never look back darling, it distracts from the now.\" \r\n\r\n*gotta catch 'em all!*\r\n\r\nand if you catch 101 of these you might have enough magikarp candy to evolve it into a gyarados!^\r\n\r\nmy version of a magikarp hat, because one can never have enough magikarps. this pattern is best suited to intermediate to experienced crafters as it involves a range of crochet stitches, multiple individual pieces and lots and lots of counting.\r\n\r\nstitches used: slst, dc, dc2tog, htr, tr, tr2tog fptr, magic ring\r\n\r\n**caution! this pattern has not been beta tested.** stitches have been counted to the best of my ability, but there is a reason i’m not a mathematician (or a census taker). your results may vary; proceed with care!\r\n\r\n** erratum: the pattern is actually in uk crochet symbols.**\r\n\r\n** erratum 2: argh! i messed up on the pattern for the dorsal fin. the increases in the pattern are meant to be decreases. shoot me now.**\r\n\r\n*^hat will not evolve into a gyarados. i mean, seriously?*",
