    "content": "this pillow gives our elbows something on which to rest which in turn brings the work closer to the face this means that we are not hunched over trying to see our stitches did you know that for every inch your head hangs forward while crocheting/knitting/playing on your cellphone/reading etc an additional eight to ten pounds of pressure is placed upon your upper back and shoulders for each and every inch talk about straining those muscles which then begin to weaken which leads to dull aches and headaches which leads to less crochet time which leads to sadness and despair for me at least"
