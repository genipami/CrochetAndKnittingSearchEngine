    "content": "a swirling and spinning circular blanket very quick to work up a simple repeating pattern that increases as you go you can make it to any size from a cushion cover right up to a big bedspread just keep following the repeating pattern * for a blanket approximately 48 /122 cm in diameter you will need three balls of batik swirl i used the shade purple mist * i used a 4 5mm hook * after three rounds my blanket measures 3 /7 6cm across however because this is a repeating pattern matching gauge is not essential simply work until your blanket is the size you want * you will also need a tapestry needle for sewing in ends * you may find stitch markers helpful the pattern is written in us terms and includes a chart of the first twelve rounds to help get you started"
