    "content": "the dupont street hat uses mosaic techniques to create the brickwork motif if you know how to knit/purl/slip_stitch you can knit this hat even if you have never done mosaic knitting before the pattern is completely written out so you don t need to know how to read a mosaic chart to complete this hat the hat is very customizable as written the hat has 11 row of brickwork and can easily be extended by repeating body of the pattern as many times as desired this can be a bit of a stash buster so dig through your old balls of yarn to find the right color palate for your version of the dupont street hat you ll want about 100y of the main color and 7-8y for each row of brickwork"
