    "content": "this fast and fun drink coaster project is my answer to something to share and give for christmas gifts i figured a set of four coasters in the same yarns and with a simple oscillation of colours for each round would look great and also be both stash friendly and economical the 6 row mandala takes almost no time to whip up with the longest part probably darning in the ends i worked in dk 8 ply acrylic yarns and used a 4 5mm hook but this project is super versatile so that you can play with hook size yarn weight and colour to your hearts content each of my coasters weighed around 10g of yarn aside from drink coaster/mug rugs this project lends itself to be used as christmas tree decorations a nice doyley set or perhaps join a bunch at the points for a festive table runner yarn requirements i used the australia craft store spotlight s 4 seasons marvel 8 ply acrylic yarn in balls of 100g for this pattern i have only worked the pattern in acrylic yarn but i feel confident it will turn out well in any yarn you choose the colours i have used for the four blue coaster set mint breakfast blue aqua teal royal blue twilight materials required 4 5mm hook yarn in your choice of colours darning needle for sewing in ends scissors stitch marker optional finished size diameter 14 5cm at widest point gauge not important"
