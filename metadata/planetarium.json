  "notes": "planetarium is a slouchy stranded colorwork beanie designed to make the most out of scraps of precious gradient yarn (handspun or otherwise). smaller star motifs dance around the brim, while the crown features a dramatic sun design—which cleverly hides the shaping and highlights the gradient. \r\n\r\nthe retro stitch pattern is reminiscent of vintage ski sweaters and makes me think of chilly morning coffee runs and winter hikes. \r\n\r\nthe handspun version is also a great way to use up odds and ends of solid and dyed braids. the singles are both chain-plied, minimizing demands for bobbin space. \r\n\r\n\r\n**size**\r\n\r\nadult s(m, l, xl)\r\n\r\n\r\n**finished measurements**\r\n\r\ncircumference:  20(21, 22, 24) inches / 51(53.5, 56, 61) cm\r\nlength:  8.5(8.5, 9, 9) inches / 21.5(21.5, 23, 23) cm – can be lengthened to preference\r\n\r\nchoose the size that’s closest to but no larger than your actual head circumference. length can be further increased by working a longer ribbing.\r\n\r\n**materials**\r\n\r\n**fiber**\r\n\r\n* (mc) paradise fibers (100% cheviot wool; top); color: white, hand-dyed with acid dyes; 2(2, 2, 2) ounces\r\n* (cc) paradise fibers (100% cheviot wool; top); color: white; 2(2, 2, 2) ounces\r\n\r\n**yarn specifications**\r\n\r\n* finished yarn:  wraps per inch: 17 wpi\r\n*  ply: chain-ply\r\n* yardage used: mc, 124 yds; cc, 89 yds \r\n* drafting method: woolen draw from the fold\r\n\r\n**commercial yarn alternative**\r\n\r\n* (mc) knit picks chroma fingering weight (70% superwash wool, 30% nylon; 396 yd/362 m per 100g skein); color: pegasus; 1(1, 1, 1) skeins\r\n* (cc) katia united socks (75% superwash wool, 25% nylon; 109 yd/100 m per 25g skein); color: 6 - white; 1(1, 1, 2) skeins\r\nnote: the commercial yarn xl size uses only one 25g ball of cc, with only about a yard or two left. my advice—buy extra, and if you have enough, make another hat!\r\n\r\n**yarn characteristics**\r\n\r\n* the yarn is a standard fingering-weight sock yarn: multiple plies with a nice twist. the nylon isn’t necessary, if you’re making a substitution, but it’s common in sock yarns; it’s fine if it’s there or not.  the cc is a solid white; any light-colored solid that contrasts with your mc will work well. the mc is a gradient which features a slow colour change. a fixed-striped variegated would also work well for the mc, but avoid very busy or fast-changing colors, as it could obscure the colorwork. you can also work with two solid or semi-solid colours for a more traditional look.\r\n\r\n**recommended needle size**\r\n\r\n(always use a needle size that gives you the gauge listed below - every knitter's gauge is unique]\r\n* 1 us #0/2 mm 16 inch/40 cm long circular needle\r\n* 1 us #2/2.75 mm 16 inch/40 cm long circular needle\r\n* us #2/2.75 mm needles for small circumference in the round\r\n\r\n**notions**\r\n\r\n* stitch markers\r\n* yarn needle \r\n\r\n\r\n**gauge**\r\n\r\n28 sts/40 rounds = 4 inches/10 cm in stockinette stitch\r\n27 sts/37.5 rounds = 4 inches/10 cm in pattern stitch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
