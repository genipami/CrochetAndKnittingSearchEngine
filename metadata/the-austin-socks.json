  "notes": "\r\nthese socks were named after my oldest son because of his help in designing the textured pattern. :) this pattern shows off a speckled yarn beautifully but then when done in a solid or tonal really just pops!\r\n\r\nthese socks are top down and has instructions for a heel flap, gusset and my favorite rounded toe.\r\n\r\nsizes available are small, medium and large. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
