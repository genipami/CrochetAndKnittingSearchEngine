  "notes": "**this is a fun and simple little project bag made using two strands of yarn held together.**\r\n\r\nto achieve results similar to mine, consider using one solid yarn colorway and one variegated colorway. or use up lots of small odds and ends to mix and match. it will be a cute finished bag that works up in just a couple of hours, and the best part is that there is no sewing or tricky stitches to work up. \r\n\r\n**skill level:** easy/beginner friendly pattern\r\n\r\n**hook:** i used a 5.0 mm to keep my stitches nice and tight, but you can use whatever hook size is most comfortable for you. \r\n\r\n**yarn options:** feel free to use any yarn that you like. the total yardage was 300 (worked using 2 strands), but you could also make this with just a single strand of yarn.\r\n\r\n**finished dimensions:** while laying flat, this bag measures 9\" from the center start to the top edge and 10.5\" at its widest.\r\n\r\n© copyright merri purdy/purdy sweet crochet 2025. all rights reserved.\r\n\r\nthe pattern and photos in this design are the property of merri purdy.\r\n\r\nas with all of my designs, i am always willing to assist if you have questions or concerns."
