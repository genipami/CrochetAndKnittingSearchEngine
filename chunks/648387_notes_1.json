    "content": "a coworker asked for a black knit hat with stripes and after not quite finding the right pattern i experimented a bit and eventually put this together it s a thick slightly oversized hat designed to be warm and quick to knit up the light stripe pattern comes from offset row of 1x1 ribbing separated by knit row i used a bit over half a ball of big twist chunky but any bulky weight yarn will do there is a lot of flex in this with the ribbing so the exact size doesn t matter much"
