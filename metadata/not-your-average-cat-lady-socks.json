  "notes": "these funky leopard print socks are knit cuff down with an afterthought heel, making it easier to concentrate on the stranded colorwork pattern without worrying about shaping the heel.\r\n\r\nsuggested yarn: allison barnes yarn-basic sock\r\nyardage is given for one pair of adult medium socks with a length of 10”\r\n• orange (mc): 200 yards (colorway- “fistful of pennies”)\r\n• dark blue (cc) - 140 yards (colorway- “i feel fine”)\r\n\r\n\r\nif you are new to the afterthought heel, i found these two videos very helpful: \r\n\r\n1) [afterthought heel part 1][1]. \r\n2) [afterthought heel part 2][2].\r\n\r\nalso, if you are struggling picking up the heel stitches [this tutorial is very helpful][3]. it's for an afterthought thumb, but the general idea is the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://knitpurlhunter.com/blog/afterthought-heel-part-1/\r\n  [2]: https://knitpurlhunter.com/blog/afterthought-heel-part-2/\r\n  [3]: http://maryjanemucklestone.com/all-thumbs/",
