    "content": "i m happy to see so many boyfriend hats here this hat is a skull cap knit in the round in 3x2 ribbing one size ideally fits a 23 5 head circumference however this pattern is made in super stretchy ribbing so the hat can fit slightly wider or smaller heads as well or you could cast on more or less stitches in multiples of 10 and still follow the pattern as written also this hat was designed to cover just the tops of ears if you want a hat that fully covers the ears knit an extra inch in ribbed pattern before starting the decreases the yardage is given as 2 full skeins however the hat actually takes over 1 skein but less than 2 of the mission falls wool but remember you might need more or less if you use a different yarn or get a different gauge **errata** row 5 of the decreases should read row 5 ^k3 p**1** p2tog repeat from ^ until end of row 50 sts remain the pattern has been fixed as of 2007-10-27 thanks archaeoknits"
