    "content": "this is a basic pattern for either a scarf or a shawl it is knitted in garter-stitch lace so no purl stitches are required the lace work adds some delicate interest to what would otherwise be a very solid accessory the pattern is written for an advanced beginner as it has defined sections as well as a few more advanced than beginner stitches however the pattern is detailed enough for a beginner to follow it while being interesting enough for an advanced knitter to enjoy it as well the scarf is designed to be about 6 5 by 70 so a generous warm accessory for any new england winter the shawl is designed to be about 26 by 60 so again it will be a cozy accessory for any chilly day however either accessory can easily be made longer or shorter as desired the gauge can be somewhat flexible as these are not fitted garments many knitters may need to change needle size to get the recommended gauge for this project especially as worsted weight yarns can vary considerably the sample shown is made using mile wide crafts hand dyed cotton boucle 2 skeins however any worsted weight yarn should work for this pattern it would be gorgeous in a worsted handspun yarn"
