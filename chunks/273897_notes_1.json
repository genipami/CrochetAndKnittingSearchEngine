    "content": "**the ribby snuggle sack is meant to be used under constant supervision and not intended for sleeping it could pose a safety hazard to baby if the fabric were to cover the baby s face at any time ** this pattern creates a stretchy snuggle sack that is great for keeping babies warm and comfortable if knit in 100% wool yarn it also doubles as a diaper cover/soaker over cloth diapers i recommend knitting with wool even if you don t intend to use it as a diaper cover as wool is a great material for helping keep baby s body temperature comfortable without getting too hot or cold the finished object is approximately 16 around 8 across laid flat and 18 long unstretched the combination of the size and the ribbing allows the sack to be snuggly and comfortable but not restrictive and also to fit various sized babies on a newborn the arms can be tucked in and the top folded down and on an infant it can be pulled up under the arms and folded down if needed don t mind the shadowy lines in the picture i used minimally processed wool so there were some darker shades in the skeins"
