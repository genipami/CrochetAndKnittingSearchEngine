    "content": "introducing the super simple sweater i created this design with the beginning crocheter in mind someone who wants to launch into their first garment project this is designed to use two stitches the half_double_crochet stitch is used for most of the body and the sleeves there are a few row of the double_crochet stitch at the bottom of the sweater for the vented section to add some style and interest however you can just use the half_double_crochet stitch all the way up if you would prefer to keep it super simple it is made of two rectangles for the body and there are two row requiring an increase on either end for the sleeves i used a neutral grey for mine but this super simple sweater would be gorgeous in any colour"
