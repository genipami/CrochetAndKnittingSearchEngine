  "notes": "**about shuttle** \r\n\r\nshuttle the shongololo is a species of millipede who live on and consume mineral-rich meteoroids in parts of the galaxy where the rocks are densely packed in asteroid clouds. they have very long bodies in order to stretch across space and move to a new meteoroid when the food runs out on their current rock. the different levels of minerals that they consume on each different space rock produce vivid colours on their bodies, and the stripes they have mark each time they moved to a new grazing slab.\r\n\r\n**about the pattern** \r\n\r\nshuttle is a customizable millipede amigurumi, whereby you can make your critter as long or as short as you please (like a pill bug)! as part of the projectarian’s year of fur event, there is also the option in this pattern to make shuttle furry, if you’re up for a fun challenge! the furry version is smaller and simpler, to preserve your sanity, but if you’re feeling extra adventurous, you can make the full-sized version furry too!\r\n\r\nshuttle’s design makes for a repetitive, meditative project, ideal for keeping your hands occupied while letting your brain off the hook (pun intended!). it doesn’t require a high level of skill or focus to complete, so even the less experienced crocheter can create a very impressive looking project with confidence and ease.\r\n\r\nthis project contains **no sewing** except to attach the feelers, all the other pieces are crocheted on as you go."
