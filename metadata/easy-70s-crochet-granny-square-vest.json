  "notes": "\r\nmaterials\r\n\r\nmedium weight (4) yarn – any brand will do! i mixed different brands together of left over yarn i had laying around because i wanted to be a bit more conscious with this project. some of the yarn i worked with linked here is a recent fave of mine, it’s very soft, anti-pilling and easy to work with.\r\n\r\n5.00mm crochet hook – my fave hooks!\r\n\r\nscissors\r\n\r\ndarning needles\r\n\r\nstitch markers – (i personally don’t use a stitch marker for this pattern, but if you lose track of where you started easily or you’re a beginner, stitch markers are very helpful.)\r\n\r\nyarn needed: i used approximately 178 grams of scrap yarn to make this vest in a size s, but i am unsure how much yarn would be needed for other sizes. i’m working on how to be able to calculate the yarn needed for multiple sizes, when i figure it out i will update this blog post!\r\n\r\npattern notes\r\n\r\n*this pattern follows size s but sizes xs-5xl are also available.\r\n\r\n*this pattern follows us crochet terms.\r\n\r\n*turning ch 3 does count as a dc stitch in this pattern.\r\n\r\n*when making granny squares, you work in ch spaces and not in sts (unless otherwise directed to)."
