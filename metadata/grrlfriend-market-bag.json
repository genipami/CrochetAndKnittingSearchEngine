  "notes": "sometimes it takes a grrlfriend to save the day!  knit this versatile market bag for a friend who could use a helping hand - even if it's just with the groceries!\r\n\r\nthe grrlfriend market bag was knit from recycled sweater yarn in a cotton/linen blend but you can use whatever yarn you like - try it in linen, dishcloth cotton, cotlin - make it with wool and full it a bit!  \r\n\r\nthe bag starts with a square bottom knit from the center outward using double pointed needles.  when the square gets big enough switch to circular needles and you're nearly there!  make your square bottom larger or smaller to adjust the finished size of the bag.  the easy lace pattern won't give you headaches and is easy on the hands with non-stretchy yarns.  finish off with a garter stitch band and sturdy handle and you've got your new favorite bag!  \r\n\r\nthere are so many details that brought this bag together. it’s not such a special pattern - it’s very similar to others i’ve seen, but it had a purpose - it had to be created to fulfil its destiny.\r\n\r\nafter a friend of mine gave me her ex husband’s old sweater hoping that i would recycle the yarn and transform it into something completely different, i pondered many things. i even wore the sweater a few times last winter wondering what it should become. then sheri of the loopy ewe announced a quarterly challenge on her blog to knit something for someone that needed a lift - someone who could benefit from a random act of knitting kindness. the bag came to life. the original bag was gifted back to my friend when she was in the hospital recovering from a hysterectomy. the sweater had been transformed and had come full circle - purging my friend of something she had to get out of her life, and symbolizing what we do for our grrlfriends - we offer support and encouragement and share each others burdens in life. i’m so happy and thankful and blessed for the grrlfriends in my life. i hope you’ll enjoy knitting this bag and maybe you have a grrlfriend who needs a little lift - even if it’s just to help her carry the groceries! :)\r\n\r\n**translations:**\r\n\r\nclick on the \"free ravelry download\" link to see the language download you seek.  if you have a translation to contribute please send me a private message to make arrangements to add yours!\r\n\r\n* thank you [missagnes](/people/missagnes) for your french translation of the grrlfriend market bag!"
