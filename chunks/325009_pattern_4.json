    "content": "best results use a yarn with good drape and which will not roll much when worked in stockinette such as linen or silk choose your stitch pattern the sample patterns are shown in stockinette but of course you can use any stitch pattern you like keep in mind that any change to the stitch pattern will affect the amount of yarn needed textured stitches especially garter stitch will use more yarn than stockinette lace patterns may use less yarn depending on the lace pattern used choose your needle size try a few swatches and decide what needle size works best for your yarn be sure to work a swatch that is at least 6 wide by 4 tall for your final swatch using the needles you will use for the wrap determine your gauge soak and block your swatch determine your gauge in stitches over 4 count the number of stitches across the center 4 of your swatch don t ignore partial stitches now calculate the number of stitches per inch by dividing the gauge amount by 4 for example if you have 16 sts over 4 divide 16 by 4 to get 4 sts per inch estimate the amount of yarn needed you can also use your swatch to calculate an approximate amount of yarn needed calculate the square inches in your swatch length multiplied by width for example if your swatch is 6 x 4 it has 24 square inches then calculate the number of square inches in the finished wrap for example if you want the wrap to be 15 x 56 the number of square inches is 840 15 x 56 estimate the yarn needed by using one of the following methods 1 if you have an accurate digital scale that will measure small weights you can weigh the swatch i suggest weighing in grams rather than ounces divide the grams by the number of square inches to determine the number of grams per square inch then multiply the result by the number of square inches in the wrap this will give you the number of grams of yarn needed for the wrap using our example above we would divide the weight of the swatch by 24 then multiply the result by 840 2 unravel the swatch and measure the length of the yarn in inches divide the length by the number of square inches in the swatch to get the length of yarn needed per square inch multiply the result by the number of square inches in the wrap to get the total length needed for the wrap in inches divide that number by 36 to calculate the number of yards needed since this is just an estimate of the yarn needed be sure to allow yourself some extra yarn over the amount calculated calculate the number of stitches to cast on multiply the number of stitches per inch by the width you want to make the wrap round up or down to a whole"
