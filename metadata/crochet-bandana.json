  "notes": "a cute crochet bandana is not only a fun and easy project to work on but also a fantastic way to show off your personal style. whether you’re going for a boho-chic vibe or a cottage-core look, a crochet bandana is a perfect accessory that will take your outfit to the next level.\r\n\r\n**size**\r\nbandana measures 8.5″ tall by 16.5″ wide, excluding ties.\r\n\r\nties measure 14″ each, but can be made longer or shorter.\r\n\r\n**gauge**\r\n5 3-dc clusters and 4.5 rows = 4″ x 4″\r\n\r\nyour gauge might be different if you use a different yarn than listed below. that’s okay. measure your triangle as you work, and crochet as many rows as you need to meet the finished measurements listed above."
