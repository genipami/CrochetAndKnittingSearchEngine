    "content": "this wrap was created specifically with breastfeeding mothers in mind created with 100% silk chenille it is both airy and beautiful the wider edges of the wrap provide enough coverage to give babies privacy while eating in public and make the wrap easy and comfortable for moms to wear it s surprisingly warm and would make a lovely shoulder wrap for mothers-to-be for those windy spring days i purchased the yarn for this wrap from ebay originally but any sport weight chenille yarn would do the wrap was kool-aid dyed with blue and cherry after it was finished i used a hook larger than recommended to create the lacy look **materials list** approximately 16oz of sport weight chenille yarn 7mm hook size k hook is slightly smaller but should be acceptable **notes** it is assumed that each row begins with either a chain 1 for single_crochet row chain 2 for half_double_crochet row and chain 3 for double_crochet row personally i reduce the number to 1 chain for single_crochet and half_double_crochet row and 2 chain for double_crochet row for my work it keeps the edges neater and doesn t leave a large gap between the beginning stitch and rest of the work us pattern notations used chain = chain single_crochet = single_crochet double_crochet = double_crochet half_double_crochet = half_double_crochet st = stitch"
