  "notes": "this pattern will teach you how to make a pot holder in the shape and colors of the progress pride rainbow flag\r\n\r\ntechniques used include crochet thermal stitch, in-line color changes, and tucking loose yarn into the rows rather than weaving them in at the end\r\n\r\nthe pattern includes 40+ full pages of instructions and step by step pictures\r\n\r\nyarn should be heat-resistant and not synthetic. i recommend 100% cotton\r\n\r\nthe finished product will be roughly 8\" wide by 6\" tall\r\n\r\nfree version\r\nif you don't need the detailed walkthrough, the basic pattern is posted in the pictures on the left. i want to see these everywhere!\r\n"
