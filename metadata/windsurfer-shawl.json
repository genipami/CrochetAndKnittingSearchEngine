  "notes": "the windsurfer shawl is a colorful triangular shawl perfect for summer nights or to wrap around you after swimming, or windsurfing, in the ocean. the combination of moss stitches and scheepjes whirl yarn makes the shawl light, soft and warm. the color transitions made with two different whirls are just mesmerizing throughout the whole project.\r\ni combined the colors 766, mid morning mocha’roo (starting from the outside) and 768, sherbet rainbow (starting from the inside) and used hook 3.0 mm. the final size is approx. 160 x 120 x 120 cm.\r\nthe windsurfer shawl is crocheted in short rows, from one side to the other, alternating between the two colors every other row. with a special technique you will not have to cut your yarn until the shawl is finished, so there will only be 4 ends to fasten at the end of the project.\r\n\r\n**pattern features:**\r\n\r\n* [video tutorial on youtube][1]\r\n\r\n* written pattern in english (us and uk terminology), danish, dutch, french, german, greek, hungarian, italian, japanese, polish, russian, slovak, spanish and swedish.\r\n* photo tutorials to show the neccesary steps of the pattern.\r\n* directions how to customize the size and information about yarn amounts needed.\r\n\r\n**stitches used in this pattern:**\r\n\r\nchain, slip stitch, single crochet (us terms).\r\n\r\n**join my facebook group:**\r\n\r\nmy facebook group “[mijo crochet hangout][2]” is a place where you can get support, ask questions, share pictures and socialize with other fellow crocheters.\r\n\r\n❀❀❀\r\n\r\nthis pattern have been fully tested, many thanks to sandra lindahl for your wonderful help with this pattern.\r\n\r\n❀❀❀\r\n\r\ndue to the nature of a pdf pattern, a refund will not be offered.\r\n\r\n❀❀❀\r\n\r\ncopyright mijo crochet 2021. this pattern is for personal use only. reproduction and publication of pictures and/or pattern is not allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3nuha84tfo&t=609s\r\n  [2]: https://www.facebook.com/groups/mijocrochethangout/"
