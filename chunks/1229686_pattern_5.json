    "content": "the structure to make the bottom of the bag sit flat i used some one sided fusible ultra firm stabilizer from joanne s its basically extra extra thick iron on interfacing cut out 2 rectangles that are the same size as the bottom of your bag or 1 square by 3 squares and iron them together use some scissors to round out the corners a tiny bit using a sewing needle and a thread that matches your yarn attach the 4 corners of the rectangle to the inside corners of the bag tying off with a knot and cutting the thread short on each stitch then attach where the sides of the rectangle meet the slip_stitch join 4 more spots this is all that is needed to hold the bag secure on the bottom thats it you did it good job congrats on your new tote bag"
