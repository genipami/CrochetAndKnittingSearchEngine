  "notes": "this pattern is my solution to the  variegated yarn conundrum - that one where a gorgeous skein of yarn refuses to knit well in a pattern, but the thought of yet another totally stockinette sock is too monotonous to bear. \r\n\r\nwith just enough pattern to maintain interest and sanity, and plenty of ‘plain’ knitting to showcase the yarn, zigzagular socks are one viable solution to this particular dilemma.\r\n\r\nthis pattern is written top-down on dpns, but is easily adaptable to be knit toe-up with one's preferred sock knitting method.\r\n\r\n***please note*** moving the start of the round as instructed on the left sock allows the “zigzag” to flow nicely from the ribbed cuff.",
