    "content": "this is a free pattern that requires knowledge of basic knitting techniques being able to follow a graph and to do stranded colorwork there is nothing fancy about this pattern it just says fuck over and over again because i m feeling exasperated with 2020 and i thought maybe you were too there is only one size available that fits most adult heads but gauge can easily be adjusted feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns about this hat happy knitting and hang in there <3"
