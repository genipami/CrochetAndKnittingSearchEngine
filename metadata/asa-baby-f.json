  "notes": "this is a free pattern that is part of my all squared away series of blanket patterns. additional design credit to maria saba.\r\n\r\nthis pattern was tested for colour blind accessibility by https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/  it will also still make sense when printed in the black/white setting on your printer.\r\n\r\n\r\nwe highly recommend making a swatch with the yarn and hook you'd like to use. your finished blanket will measure approximately 6.5 times bigger than an 8-round granny square (alas, there are no 8-round squares in the design - don't cut the yarn if you'd like to use this swatch in the blanket; you can add or subtract rounds as desired.)\r\n\r\nthis pattern uses the continuous joining method described in this tutorial: https://www.ravelry.com/discuss/fantasticmio/4069169/1-25\r\nor this video tutorial: https://youtu.be/lo40rxgsxpm\r\n\r\n\r\nthis was an mcal - check out the thread [here][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/discuss/fantasticmio/4192469/1-25"
