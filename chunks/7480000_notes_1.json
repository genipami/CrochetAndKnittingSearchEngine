    "content": "i had a pair of headphones that still worked but the ear pads were falling apart i came up with this crochet pattern to cover the pads and extend the life of my headphones the pattern includes the stitch count i needed to fit my headphones but will likely need to be adjusted to fit yours the nice thing about this pattern is that you can test it by putting it on your headphones as you work to test the fit i used cotton yarn and a compatible size crochet hook but again you can adjust to whatever yarn/hook you would like to use"
