    "content": "**about** the spring valley bandeau is such an easy top to make you can use this as a template to make your own bandeau tops using any stitch pattern it s honestly as simple as making a rectangle if you can crochet a rectangle you can make this top i worked it in a stitch pattern that alternates single_crochet and chain however feel free to replace this stitch pattern with literally any stitch pattern you like i used wecrochet hawthorne 1 for this top but you can replace this with any fingering weight yarn or any other weight of yarn if you prefer this piece is very customizable and you can adjust the length the width the stitch pattern add straps and add any amount of ruching you like **ruching** the ruching or the pinching in the front of the top is as simple as weaving a strand of yarn in a u-shape and pulling tight that s it **sizing** this is a simple tutorial to make a bandeau for any body no matter your shape or size you can customize it to fit your exact measurements this pattern is #sizeinclusive the sample shown is worn on a 34 bust and measures 29 in circumference for a top that is worn with approx 5 of negative ease the negative ease is crucial when making this top otherwise it will fall down your body as soon as you put it on this may seem like a *lot* of negative ease but this is what keeps it in place during wear you want it to be snug to your body but not restricting you can try with less negative ease for example 3-4 of negative ease but it s better to have your finished bandeau to be on the smaller side than have it too big if you work it too small you can always work a few row of single_crochet to the edge before joining into a tube to add some more fabric *you cannot however take fabric away if you make it too big * the linked blog post illustrates all of this and also how to add very simple straps if you feel you need extra support **how to wear** this top can be worn braless with bra or with pasties - whatever you prefer just note that if you plan on wearing a bra take your bust measurement while wearing your bra if you plan on wearing it with just pasties make sure you take your bust measurement braless to get an appropriate fit for your body **construction** this top is worked in a simple rectangle that gets seamed together the reason i chose to seam it vs work in the round is so that you have another chance to adjust it once you re finished you can also work it in a spiral or in joined rounds but this eliminates any opportunity to adjust it at the end if it s too tight you won t have"
