  "notes": "create louise belcher's favourite toy from the show bob's burgers!\r\n\r\nfor this pattern, i used roughly 160-175g of lime green (a little less than 4 skeins of yarn), 5g of champagne white (< 1 skein), a little bit of pure black for the pupils.\r\n\r\ni chose to work with paintbox yarns for this project because it comes in so many colours and makes colour-matching for this specific project so easy. however, you can use any cotton yarn as long as you correspond your hook to the weight of your yarn.\r\n\r\nkuchi kopi measures to be about 10 inches (25cm) tall.\r\n\r\n\r\n**terminology**\r\n\r\nst(s): stitch(es)\r\nch: chain\r\nsc: single crochet\r\ninc: two single crochet in one stitch\r\ndec: invisible decrease, single crochet two stitches together through the front loops only\r\n(…) x #: repeat anything in the parenthesis however many times the number indicates\r\n[#]: total number of stitches for that row\r\n#sc: one sc in the following # stitches\r\n\r\n\r\n**things you need**\r\n\r\npaintbox yarns cotton aran in lime green, champagne white, and pure black\r\n3.5mm crochet hook\r\nscissors\r\ndarning needle\r\nlocking stitch markers\r\npins\r\npolyfil stuffing or scrap yarn"
