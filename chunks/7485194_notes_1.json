    "content": "achillea is a floral-inspired granny square the motif was inspired by the ironwork flowers found on the friezes of the victorian houses in my local area the square uses mostly standard stitches with a few engaging elements including cluster stitches and gentle front post work to shape the petals it s relaxing to make with enough interest to keep you engaged without needing too much concentration perfect for lap blankets cushions or stash-busting projects suitable for any yarn weight but the finished size will vary 7 rounds = 15cm i d love to see your achillea squares use #achilleagrannysquare or #brigidcollective when sharing online for pattern support you can contact me at brigidcollective@outlook com hope you enjoy"
