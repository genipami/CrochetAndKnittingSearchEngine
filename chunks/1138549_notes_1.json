    "content": "i designed this tea towel to match the willow dishcloth a design from last spring that has been the most popular dishcloth i have designed so far it s a simple pattern that combines knit and purl stitches to create beautiful and unique texture i think this towel would make a lovely gift or addition to your own kitchen it s modern but timeless and i hope you enjoy knitting it as much as i enjoyed designing i have added some helpful tips in the notes section this towels take a little over one skein of dishie cotton so i recommend buying two skeins and using the rest to make dishcloths you can also find this pattern for free on my blog kneedlesandlife com but there will be ads and it is not printable thanks"
