  "notes": "this crochet basket made from scrap yarn is the perfect craft project to use up all those leftover yarn ends that just seem to multiply.\r\n\r\nthe perfect stashbuster to use up ugly yarn.\r\n\r\ni used a 9mm hook and held about 4-5 strands of dk (8ply) yarn together to make a really firm fabric with single crochet (us) stitch. \r\n\r\nyou can use an assortment of different weight yarns to make a similar weight to super chunky or jumbo yarn. \r\n\r\nif you have lots of little yarn ends, make several balls of yarn just by knotting the ends together, similar to a magic yarn ball, but the joins don’t have to be invisible."
