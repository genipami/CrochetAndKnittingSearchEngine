    "content": "these mitts were knitted for my mother-in-law who has terribly painful arthritic hands and in particular thumbs i wanted a pattern that would fit her snugly and gave support to her hands but would be warm and stylish as well i couldn t find this elusive pattern that was in my mind so i combined various ideas from several existing free patterns to create this one in short i frankensteined it to give the desired hand support i used super bulky weight yarn and needles that were two sizes smaller than recommended on the yarn label the result was a thick dense fabric that really hugs the hand i also included a fitted thumb gusset and a snugger-than-usual thumb the only thing to do now is knit a pair for myself they feel great and since they knit up in about 4-6 hours it won t be long"
