  "notes": "the perfect mini gift bag for small things like jewellery, gift cards, sweets etc.  \r\n \r\nit is a beginner friendly mosaic design as there are no special stitches, just sc and dc.  \r\n\r\nthe blue background only used 70m and the white used 43m of catona yarn, so less than one 50g ball of each colour.  one gift bag using scheepes catona yarn and a 2.5mm hook measures 16.5 cm x 11 cm (6 ½” x 4 ¼”) not including the bottom edging.\r\n\r\npattern contains written instructions, mosaic chart and a link to my video for the join.  it is worked in the round like a tube.  included are instructions on mosaic overlay techniques and chart reading.  if this is your first mosaic project, you will find many youtube videos if you need further help.  search for beginners guide to mosaic crochet.  \r\n\r\nwhen choosing yarn, it is important to choose contrasting colours so the pattern stands out.  \r\n\r\nthe designs in my other pattern christmas mug rugs are the same size as the mosaic section in this pattern, so they can easily be used for mini gift bags.  https://ravel.me/mosaic-christmas-mug-rugs\r\n",
