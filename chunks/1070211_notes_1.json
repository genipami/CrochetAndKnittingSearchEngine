    "content": "zeena the mini crochet witch is the newest member of our kozu palm pals series of mini crochet dolls as halloween is approaching we realised that our kozu palm pals needed a costume for trick-or-treating and so the idea for zeena the mini crochet witch was born at 4 5 inches tall without the hat she works up really fast is easy to make and is oh so cute zeena has the same body as all of our kozu palm pals and so her hair cap can be swapped with any of the other dolls in the series her hat and dress are removable so she can be changed into any of the clothes from our other dolls once halloween is over or you could even sew the hat onto her head attach at keychain ring and you have a lovely backpack charm we made our witch using dk yarn and a 2 5 mm hook but any yarn with the relevant hook will work with worsted weight/aran yarn she s slightly bigger at just over 5 inches"
