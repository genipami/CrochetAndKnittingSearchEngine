  "notes": "this knit hat features lots of easy cabling, including a 3-strand braided cable, one of my absolute design favorites.\r\n\r\ntechniques include:\r\ntwisted german cast on\r\nknitting in the round\r\ncables\r\n\r\nmaterials: \r\n45 (60, 63, 67)g worsted weight yarn (220y/200m per 100g)\r\nus 6/4mm - 16\" length and us8/5 mm - 16” length and/or preferred small circumference knitting (magic loop or dpn) \r\n4 stitch markers\r\ncable needle\r\ntapestry needle\r\n\r\nthis hat has a large amount of stretch, so each size can accommodate a large range of head circumference. for a slouchier fit, work the entire chart as listed. for a more fitted style, knit to 1” less than the total length you would like your hat to fit. \r\n\r\nthe cable pattern is charted only.",
