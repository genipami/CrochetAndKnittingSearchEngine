    "content": "this is a recipe-style pattern gauge and yardage required will vary based on the size of feet you re making for and the yarn you use you will need to take multiple measurements and do calculations **i recommend scrolling to look at all the photos before starting ** i am not a professional pattern writer and **i am not providing any support for this pattern** it is written to the best of my ability using some non-standard charting methodology which i hope i have explained clearly and will be challenging to follow if you re not comfortable with the techniques required slip_stitch ribbing and calculating based on measurements + your gauge -- one modification i am trying out is to skip the heel flap the extra rectangular chunk below the ankle portion and come back later to add in a rectangular single_crochet panel instead instructions are *not* included but it does create a more durable heel and snug heel"
