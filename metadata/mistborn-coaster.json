  "notes": "**this is a pay what you want pattern! use the code mistborn50 for 50% off the original price or use the code mistborn100 for a free copy. if you download for free, i’d love it if you gave this pattern a ❤️. thank you for your support!\r\n\r\nintroducing the mistborn coaster pattern! this charming coaster combines simplicity with a touch of elegance, making it perfect for both beginners and seasoned crocheters. using basic stitches like single crochet and double crochet, the design comes together quickly and easily, while the delicate lacy scallop border adds a beautiful finishing touch. whether you're crafting a set for your own home or as a thoughtful handmade gift, the mistborn coaster is sure to bring a soft, textured charm to any table. let’s dive into this fun and relaxing project!\r\n\r\nthis pattern is made in dk weight yarn with a 4.5mm hook. i think a synthetic or plant fiber is best for a coaster, as you will want it to be easy care. this coaster is worked in the round in double crochet stitch. you work increases every round and end with a lacy, scalloped edging. gauge is not crucial in such a small piece.\r\n\r\nthis pattern is written for one size which should be a perfect fit for most mugs. if you find that it is too small/too large for your mug, i encourage you to experiment with another gauge or the number of increase rounds.\r\n\r\nthis is a beginner friendly pattern, it uses basic stitches and includes a photo tutorial at the end of the written instructions. there are also links to video tutorials for all the special techniques.\r\n\r\nthank you for choosing my pattern. i hope you enjoyed it. you may sell as many of the finished items as you wish, but if you share on social media please give me credit @stopitharry on ravelry and link the pattern to its source. if you have any questions or need pattern support, please contact me @stopitharry on ravelry. i appreciate your support!\r\n\r\na huge thank you to all my amazing testers [divavonpurl](/people/divavonpurl), [signergirl1](/people/signergirl1), [jooleej](/people/jooleej), [rachelleb16](/people/rachelleb16), [yayalovestoknit](/people/yayalovestoknit), [katisha](/people/katisha), [lavenderknits44](/people/lavenderknits44), [lnwilson96](/people/lnwilson96), and [czerwonykapturek](/people/czerwonykapturek)! this pattern wouldn’t be possible without you.\r\n"
