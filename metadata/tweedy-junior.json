  "notes": "cute little jumper with raglan shaping. top down construction. it will look adorable on any baby. ample, stretchy neckline thanks to a tubular cast on. this jumper is particularly good for big headed babies (like my jay!), though any baby will appreciate the ease this neckline slides on with."
