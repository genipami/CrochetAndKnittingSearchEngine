  "notes": "this is a gorgeous and popular pattern that has been circulating around for years, written and re-written by many people, in this re-write i have used all american english crochet terminology, using \"modules\" of stitches to make it easier to understand the construction of the pattern. this is a really fun and easy pattern once you get the hang of it, and it works up quickly to make a really sweet gift for a baby or just about anyone...who doesn't love a hand made soft snugly blanket? :)\r\n\r\n\r\nany yarn/hook can be used to make this pattern - example shown was in worsted weight with an i hook.\r\n\r\n",
