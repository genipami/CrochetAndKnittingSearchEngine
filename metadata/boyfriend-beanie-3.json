(double pointed needles)\r\n\r\nstory behind the pattern: funny thing. i called it the \"boyfriend beanie\" because they both start with b's. but that delish fellow in the photos is my husband. and... he was just modeling the hat. i actually made it for my dad. he never requests anything but wanted a basic ribbed, brimmed hat to keep his head and ears warm while he checks on his cows over on the farm so i whipped out my needles and voila. this hat was born. we snapped the pictures and then bundled up the hat and sent it off on its way to my pa.\r\n\r\nso there you have it! if you love it, please pin it, tweet it, facebook it, instagram it, ya know. if you want. ;)\r\n\r\nchandi\r\n\r\nyou may sell the items you make using my patterns. i just ask that you link back to my shop. thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.expressionfiberarts.com/\r\n  [2]: https://www.expressionfiberarts.com/faqs/"
