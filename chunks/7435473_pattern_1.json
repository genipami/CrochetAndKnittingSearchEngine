    "content": "sweet & simple checkered blanket pattern by @jessiejensen on ravelry at its core this is a very simple pattern worked entirely in double_crochet each checkerboard square is 10 stitches wide and 6 row tall however i have lots of pointers on how best to accomplish that and easily manage the many color changes this pattern is worked by carrying the inactive yarn all throughout the blanket it s a wonderful way to do all the color changes without having a million ends to weave in but the carried yarn does show through a bit in the end result for that reason i highly recommend choosing your colors carefully a lighter more mellow/pastel color won t show through white or ivory nearly as much as a brighter or darker one will always change color as the final yarn-over of the 10th double_crochet yarn management tip keep your skeins about a foot apart from each other when changing color yarn the new color over relative to where the skein is next to you so that the two yarns don t become crossed as you constantly swap the colors this will make more sense after your first couple of color changes crochet over the inactive yarn tugging lightly on it before each color change to keep it nice and flat when doing the turning chains alternate the colors to walk the colors up so they are both at the height of the new row i typically use hobby lobby s i love this yarn for this pattern and it uses ~1 5 skeins of each color about 1000 yards total color a is the main color and color b is white/ivory use your favorite worsted weight yarn sweet & simple checkered blanket pattern page 1 of 2 pattern in color a loosely chain 90 or any larger odd-interval of 10 if you want a bigger blanket 110 130 150 170 etc plus 1 for turning chain row 1 single_crochet in each st til end of row chain 2 turn ** for the next 6 row double_crochet in each st alternating colors a and b every 10 st chain 2 turn at the end of the 6th row of double_crochet change colors to begin the contrasting block ** repeat between asterisks until the blanket is your desired length but with color a in each of the 4 corners i like to make these blankets square 9 blocks x 9 blocks do not cut and fasten_off yarn using the current color should be color a you will continue around for the border chain 1 and single_crochet all the way around the blanket adding two extra stitches as you round each corner will prevent them from curling i have no good method for single crocheting along the sides btw just do the best you can eyeballing the placement then follow attic24 s bobble shell pattern https //attic24 typepad com/weblog/bobbleshell-edging html note you don t need to add any extra bobbles at the corners just run the"
