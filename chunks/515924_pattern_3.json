    "content": "weight of yarn and different needles all that is needed for the design to work is to make sure that the length of the knitted piece is twice its width measure the width when the length seems to be roughly at the halfway point this will give a more accurate measurement to work with than measuring earlier on would using a different stitch pattern based on the principle of creating a piece with length = twice width the pod could be adapted to be made in other stitch patterns robustly textured and regular stitch patterns such as seed stitch will work well as they will support the weight of the pod and withstand folding without collapsing the knitted fabric if choosing to knit the pod in a stitch with more drape such as stockinette stocking stitch knitting at a tight gauge may help to support the pod only substitute the stitch pattern for the basket rib you will still need to work the row before and after that to create the opening edges and top loop copyright \u00a9 ellen kapusniak 2014 for pattern support email ellen@knittipoliti com"
