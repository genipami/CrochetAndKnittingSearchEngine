  "notes": "> this is the dec '24 - jan '25 mkal for the [solidsocks](/groups/solidsocks) group. clues will be released on dec 1, 8, 15, and 22.\r\n\r\n“highwayman” was a #1 hit for the highwaymen, a country supergroup composed of willie nelson, kris kristofferson, waylon jennings, and johnny cash. it’s a lovely song, performed by some of my favourite artists. the structure of the song lends itself very well to the mystery sock format.\r\n\r\ninstructions are provided for two sizes: m (l), with 68 (80) stitches per round. the fit is similar to a vanilla sock with 62 (70) stitches per round, to fit a foot circumference of 8.5 (9.5)\". most of the pattern is charted only. you may use any technique you prefer for knitting a tube in the round.\r\n\r\nyou will need 100g of solid-coloured sock yarn. for best effects, pick a plump yarn with good stitch definition.",
