  "notes": "this parade of rainbow coloured gnomes is a fun addition to your christmas decorations or you could just knit one for a quick gift. \r\n\r\nthe gnomes are small enough to fit in your hand and only use very small amounts of dk weight yarn. you will need two shades of one colour per gnome; the darker one for the body and the lighter one for the hat.\r\n\r\nthe main body is knitted in the round and stuffed as you go, using a combination of a bean bag and toy stuffing. then the beard, nose and the brim of the hat are knitted separately and sewn on before adding a small jingle bell to the top of the hat.\r\n\r\nall my ravelry patterns are free to download but, if you enjoy them,\r\nplease consider making a donation to the british liver trust where\r\nthe money will go to fund research and support the families of\r\nchildren with a liver disease. you can do this easily by going to my\r\nfundraising page [here][1]\r\n\r\nhappy gnome knitting!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.justgiving.com/page/frankie-brown",
