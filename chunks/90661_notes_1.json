    "content": "this pattern is fairly simple and worked in rounds i especially liked that the petals can be molded to look however you want them i chose flat petals with a star shape in the center i also thought it might look very pretty with a decorative button or jewel sewn to the center i envisioned a larger jewel or button so that i could hold the petals in place also my flower is grey because it was designed with a specific project in mind"
