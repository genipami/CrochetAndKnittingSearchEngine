    "content": "this sock was designed for sock madness 5 it features a traveling slip_stitch pattern that works well with variegated semi-solid or solid yarns it has a heel flap with a riverbed gusset and a star toe note the cuff on this sock has a tendency to flare out a bit you may want to work it with smaller needles **size adjustments** if you re working the m 72st size but want a narrower foot 64st you can set aside 4 repeats of the diamond pattern instead of the 5 repeats specified in the pattern for the instep that means the heel flap will have 39 sts instead of 31 and will have fewer row than the m size here are the modifications needed *heel flap* -- work over the next 39 sts repeat row 1 & 2 16 times *heel turn* -- follow the original instructions for the l 72st size *foot* -- follow the original instructions for the s 64st size"
