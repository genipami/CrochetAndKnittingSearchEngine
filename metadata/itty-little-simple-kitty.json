  "notes": "when i was learning to crochet, i was always searching for free patterns that i could practice with at my level.   i wrote this pattern with that in mind;  a simple pattern that incorporates the most basic shapes of amigurumi that can be made by novice and expert alike.\r\n\r\n**this is the basic pattern for the itty little kitty!**  \r\nthis is a free download, and great for a beginner in crochet.   it includes all the body part directions, but not the color changes.\r\n\r\n**calico & tuxedo version**\r\nif you would like to purchase the instructions for the color changes for the calico and tuxedo, (or love the simple pattern so much you want to buy me a caffinated beverage) it is available in my ravelry store here:\r\n[https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/itty-little-kitties][1]\r\n\r\n**cat'hulhu version also available!**\r\ntentacle kitty just gives snuggier cuddles.\r\n[https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/itty-little-cathulhu-the-cat-octopus][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nmaterials required:\r\n3mm hook\r\ntapestry needle (for sewing)\r\nmarbles/rocks/etc for added weight. (optional)\r\n12mm - 15mm safety eyes\r\n8mm safety nose (optional)\r\ndoll stuffing\r\n\r\nthese itty little kitties can be made with any yarn, as long as you use a hook small enough that there are no gaps between the stitches. i used both red heart super saver and vanna's choice.\r\n  \r\nthank you for loving these itty little kitties as much as i do!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/itty-little-kitties\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/itty-little-cathulhu-the-cat-octopus",
