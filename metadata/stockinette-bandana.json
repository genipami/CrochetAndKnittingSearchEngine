  "notes": "this is a beginner friendly, solid knit bandana using the stockinette stitch. i designed this pattern to be knit sideways because the stockinette stitch allows for the ties to be stretchier.\r\n\r\nit's very easy to adapt the sizes for this bandana to customize it to be exactly how you want it, or the amount of yarn you are using.\r\n\r\nthere is no gauge listed because it is intended to be knit with different yarn weights/needle sizes. \r\n\r\nwhen choosing your needle size i would suggest going with the larger needle appropriate for the yarn weight because it allows for it to lay with more drape.\r\n\r\nboth of the versions i knit used 100g of yarn.\r\n\r\nthe pattern will be available on youtube saturday, march 22nd."
