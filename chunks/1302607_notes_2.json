    "content": "day i may revisit it to make it more sizes as for what yarns you need this was what i used totalling 1076m 1176 yards however the amount you need will vary depending on your gauge also i was very economical with my yarn so you may need more than this even if you have the same gauge yellow scheepjes cahlista yellow gold 340m 371 8 yds orange scheepjes cahlista tangerine 255m 278 9 yds grey paintbox yarns cotton aran granite grey 170m 185 9 yds note this was my total for my original version with an overly large neck hole someone has kindly pointed out that the current version with a normal size neck hole requires more grey because duh i guess they used 300m light green scheepjes cahlista willow 161 5m 176 6 yds dark green rico design creative cotton aran ivy 22 1m 24 2 yds light brown scheepjes cahlista hazelnut 44 2m 48 3 yds dark brown scheepjes cahlista black coffee 6 8m 7 4 yds black rico design creative cotton aran black 73 1m 80 0 yds white scheepjes cahlista bridal white 3 4m 3 7 yds this project requires pretty specific colours of yarn if you don t want to use what i used here are some manufacturers i ve found that make yarns in a large number of colourways these may or may not be appropriate for your project knit picks paintbox rico creative scheepjes hobbii jamieson s harrisville and no it doesn t have to be cotton i just used cotton because it tends to come in more colours please suggest other yarn options if you know of any **how hard is this pattern i ve never knit a sweater/intarsia/colourwork/seamed a sweater before is that ok is this a good first project ** first of all this is an absolutely terrible first project probably one of the worst ones you could pick difficulty-wise i d say it s more fiddly than hard but if you ve never knit intarsia you re probably gonna have gauge issues it s also not that well documented i mean i did my best but i ve never written a pattern in my life and there were no testers or editors involved so there s a bunch of stuff you may just have to figure out on your own so ideally you want to be a confident knitter who isn t scared off by that most important things you must be able to knit with consistent gauge there s no such thing as knit until sleeve measures x inches in this pattern everything is a set number of stitches the stitches need to be the same size or your measurements will be wrong you must be ok with doing an insane amount of intarsia if you ve never done intarsia before i recommend trying a smaller project first if you ve never made a sweater eh that s fine it helps if you ve done some other"
