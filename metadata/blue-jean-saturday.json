  "notes": "this one skein, easy wear shawl will look beautiful with your favorite blue jeans on a saturday……..but honestly, it will look great with anything on any day! this pattern was designed for my friend dawn at [the wooly cabin on etsy][1], using her “blue jean saturday sock yarn”. i used all but 40” of the 463-yard skein. this is a very easy pattern to adjust in size, quit whenever you want in the pattern or make it bigger with more yarn. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.etsy.com/shop/thewoolycabin",
