  "notes": "great stash buster project. use any hook and yarn you want. \r\n\r\npattern uses about 30 grams of worsted weight yarn with a 5.0 mm hook to produce a cozy to fit a 100 gram cake. instructions are included to make a cozy for any sized cake or ball using any hook and yarn you choose. all you need is a ruler. you can replace my use of hdc in the 3rd loop with any stitch you'd like.\r\n\r\nthis cozy came about because my dogs like to take off with my fresh cakes. these cozies are made to keep your cake intact while you work with it from the center pull. these have a snug fit so the cake will not keep its shape if you continually put it in the cozy and take it out. i put it in and leave it in until my project is done. my dogs can run off with them and not ruin my cake.\r\n\r\npattern has not been fully tested, i do not have access to reliable testers. feel free to note any mistakes you may find and i will correct the pattern as needed."
