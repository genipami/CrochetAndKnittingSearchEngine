  "notes": "emily's ravelry page: [emilyisknitting1](/people/emilyisknitting1)\r\n\r\nwelcome to tommy and emily's balakalva bash: the any-gauge balaclava.\r\n\r\nthis is an any-gauge balaclava pattern, with the option to knit it with positive ease (looser fit) or negative ease (tighter fit) depending on your preference. since this pattern is any-gauge, you can use any yarn and any texture you want to! the pattern is written in stockinette with ribbed edges but feel free to experiment with it.\r\n \r\nthis pattern is designed to be accessible to knitters at all levels. we hope that this pattern gives you a chance to learn new techniques, experiment with gauge, and (most importantly, we think) frolic all winter long in your brand new balaclava! \r\n\r\nyou will need 100-150g of the yarn of your choosing for this pattern. it will most likely take 100g or less to make this balaclava, but if you are using a bulkier yarn and/or are making the l size with positive ease, you might need a bit more than 100g of yarn.\r\n\r\nthe blue sample is made to the medium size with positive ease using lang phoenix tweed.\r\n\r\nthe purple sample is made to the large size with negative ease using various worsted weight scrap yarns. the amount of yarn use totals to less than 100g.\r\n\r\njoin the kal here: discord.gg/kunjnuz79g\r\n",
