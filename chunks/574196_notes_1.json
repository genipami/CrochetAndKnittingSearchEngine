    "content": "the strong heel was developed by gerdine crawford-strong and first published in the fall 2003 issue of knitter s magazine this heel does not require picking up stitches along a heel flap because of the constructions it is not the snuggest fitting heel which is why i have chosen to work it in a 2x2 rib instead of using the more common stockinette"
