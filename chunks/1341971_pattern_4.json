    "content": "one corner of the cheek should then end up roughly at point b point c is the corner that sits on the line going through the middle of the plushie and is where the head floof will connect somewhere with the back floofs point c is where you want to start sewing the two head floofs together which is where the video on this part begins https //youtu be/ofzbetarcow you can see me sew from point c straight up to point a where i switch to attaching the beak to one head floof you can see me first try out exactly where everything will attach and how it ll look with stitch markers which i do recommend to check out throughout the process in the video you can see me then attach the various pieces of the face together - it doesn t really matter in what order or exactly what colour tail you use here i used a black one to sew blue and white parts together because i like the slightly sloppy look and didn t want to attach a new tail just to sew with but you can do whatever and now for the worst part yet attaching the head to the body this is a royal pain and is coincidentally also the most free-hand heavy part my rules for this are to sew the bottom edges of the cheeks on in a non-straight manner to achieve maximum fullness and to base everything else off of that initial point of attachment the back edges and sides of the head will not line up exactly with the opening of the body but instead overlap a little bit the way i ve attached them this is the part where sewing from the inside stops being possible don t worry about it remember to stuff every part as you sew up the final opening now that your sawgaw is almost complete the final part is easy again just sew on the feet and don t forget to stuff them without the feet depending on how your head attachment went your sawgaw might not be able to stand upright you now have your very own sawgaw floof enjoy"
