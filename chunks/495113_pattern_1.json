    "content": "any size any yarn garter square yarn any weight of yarn may be used to make any size square i recommend having at least 50 to 60 yards of worsted weight yarn to make an 8 inch square finished size s fully customizable you could conceivably make a large square blanket if you had enough yarn on hand gauge i recommend a fairly snug gauge for the weight of yarn you are using as garter stitch is quite stretchy and a denser gauge makes a warmer blanket but any gauge you are happy with will work fine needles whatever needle size is appropriate for your yarn and gives you a fabric you re happy with straight needles are easiest for me to use for these squares but circulars are just fine if you prefer them notes the square is knit in garter stitch in two sections on the diagonal the first half increases every row and the second half decreases every row increase half using the long tail method cast on 3 stitches row 1 knit front and back of first stitch then knit to end of row repeat row 1 until your square measures your required dimension along one of the short sides not the stitches on the needle decrease half row 1 knit to last two stitches of row knit 2 together repeat row 1 until you have three stitches left on your needle final row knit 1 knit 2 together then pass first stitch over the knit 2 together as if to bind off cut the yarn and pull through remaining stitch to finish your square may be a little diamond shaped when fresh off the needles but a little reshaping with your fingers should pull it into square wash and block as desired for your yarn pattern copyright to holly terrell 2014 you are welcome to use this pattern to make squares for yourself for others for sale or for charitable use you may not sell the pattern itself please direct any questions to corvidae on ravelry thank you for knitting my design 1"
