    "content": "this was the pattern for round #5 of sock madness 6 a speed knitting contest see the sock madness forever group 1 for more information > the color pattern of these socks is neither achieved by an intarsia nor an embroidery method it s done by simply weaving in the contrast colored yarn between the stitches while knitting a plain stockinette sock with the main color in estonian knitting this technique is called roosimine which means rose and the corresponding patterns are called roositud patterns traditionally it s used on mittens and socks and most roositud patterns are quite geometrical and done in a set of bright primary colors you can find some real estonian examples here http //www tlu ee/opmat/ku/mlt6008/roosimine html http //www tlu ee/opmat/ku/mlt6008/roositud_motiivid html to make it easier to get used to this very versatile technique and to have less ends to weave in i used only one color for the weaving strands on these socks but it lends itself to using up small pieces of leftover yarns in multiple colors for the roositud motif so go wild and work each of the little curlicues in a different color if you like oh - by the way to prevent being bored to death by a plain stockinette foot after all that fun with the roosimine there is some arch shaping and a bit of striping going on too 1 http //www ravelry com/groups/sock-madness-forever"
