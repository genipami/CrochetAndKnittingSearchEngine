  "notes": "hey everyone and welcome to the granny hexagon cardigan! a great way of using up some yarn scraps. it is such a fun garment to make, and the colour combinations are endless! this cardigan is made up from 2 hexagons. it is made to measure so you can use any yarn and any hook. i have based the yarn yardage on dk weight but ultimately you can use any ply of yarn. i look forward to seeing everyone’s version of the granny hexi! please note that the larger sizes will have much wider sleeves and will be a bit longer in length due to the way that the cardigan is constructed."
