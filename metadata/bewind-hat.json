  "notes": "**helpful notes:**\r\nthese are the answers to the questions i am asked over and over. hopefully this will help for smooth knitting. :smiley: \r\n\r\n> after you work your ribbing, **make\r\n> sure you work the set up round.**\r\n> \r\n> in order to get the swirl, you have to\r\n> start with an **odd** number of\r\n> stitches. the setup round will bring\r\n> your stitch count to an odd number if\r\n> you are not there already.\r\n\r\n> when you begin the twisted stitch\r\n> repeats, you are going to have 1\r\n> stitch left before the marker. you\r\n> will **ignore** the marker from here\r\n> on out!\r\n> \r\n> if you feel like the marker is going\r\n> to be a mental block, (it can also be\r\n> a pain when you have to twist where\r\n> the marker is), then **use a removable\r\n> marker** a row or two down instead, and just move it up\r\n> a few rows at a time until you are\r\n> ready to start the crown.\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nthe bewind hat uses a simple twisted stitch pattern to create a lovely winding motif that spirals its way up to the top of the crown. if you can work a knit 2 together (k2tog), then you can knit the twisted stitch. beginner friendly!\r\n\r\nchoose one skein of your favorite worsted weight yarn and you’ll have a new favorite winter hat in no time!\r\n\r\n",
