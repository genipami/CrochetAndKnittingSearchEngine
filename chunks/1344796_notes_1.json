    "content": "the brain eater hat came into being a few years ago when my grandson was into monsters i remembered when i was a kid and my brother would put his hand on my head and ask what s this to which he would then add it s a brain eater and it s starving as annoying as it was for me as a child it is one of those silly little memories that i look back on now and smile this is my third time making it and i finally wrote the pattern down as i went materials needed worsted weight yarn - two different shades of blue or color of your choice white red black & yellow hooks - 5 5mm for body and 4 5mm for all other parts scissors yarn needle stitch marker pattern is worked from the top down and each round is joined with a slip_stitch using the 5 5mm hook and worsted weight yarn you will end up with a hat that should fit up to a 23 inch head a larger hook will make a larger hat as a smaller hook will make a smaller hat also a thinner yarn dk for example will probably end up with a slightly smaller hat as well smaller sizes could be made by decreasing the amount of increase rounds gauge is not really important i have found over the many times i have made this hat that a 5mm hook works quite well for a medium sized hat there is a typo in the pattern - when making the esca lure it reads round 11 after rounds 6-12 this obviously should be round 13"
