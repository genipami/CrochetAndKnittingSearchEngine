  "notes": "the fisherman’s hottie sweater is knit bottom-up in the round and features double moss stitch, broken rib and diamond cables in the middle. there is no cable needle needed for knitting the cabled pattern. the corners are rounded by doing increases/ decreases and the bottle neck features a two-by-two rib.\r\n\r\nthis design is inspired by the textured patterns of fishermen’s sweaters. it brings the maritime “scandi” style into your home and is the perfect cozy addition to your knitwear collection. it is also a perfect gift knit, as the pattern is easy to memorize and knits up quite quickly. since it doesn’t need much yarn, it would also be a good scrappy project – just let your creativity run free and enjoy your knitting time!\r\n\r\nsize: the measurements of the cover are calculated to fit a 0,5 l hot water bottle that measures approximately 265 x 155 mm.\r\n\r\ngauge: 24 stitches and 32 rounds over 10 cm/ 4” in textured pattern knitted in the round, after washing and blocking.\r\n\r\nto make this, you will need:\r\n- approximately 155 meters (about 170 yards) of a heavier dk weight (not including the yarn needed for the gauge swatch). i used drops lima. it took about 70 gr of drops lima to make the cover.\r\n\r\n- 3,75 mm 80 cm cable needles (if you’re using the magic loop technique), or 3,75 mm 40 cm cable needles, or whichever needle size you need to achieve gauge.\r\n\r\n- 3 mm 80 cm cable needles if you’re using the magic loop technique, or 3 mm double-pointed needles\r\n\r\n- a tapestry needle\r\n\r\n- a stitch marker\r\n\r\nplease note that this is my first design and the first time i tried to write up a pattern. if there is anything unclear or you have any questions, please don't hesitate to comment and i will get back to you as soon as possible.\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy the pattern!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
