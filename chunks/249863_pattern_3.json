    "content": "3 sole to follow the stripe principle of the rest of the design the sole of the sock is meant to be constructed in three strips as well with the gusset decreases being worked along the sides of the central strip however for people with particularly sensitive feet or limited circulation this can be a problem since they will feel the two resulting ridges under the foot so i have included an alternative where the sole is worked in a single piece 3 strip version going down the right side of your flap pick up and purl the first stitch but then skip the next slipped stitch and pick up and purl the 3rd then the 5th and so on until you have 10 new sts on your needle or a quarter of the row worked for the flap there should be one more slipped stitch left pick up and purl that one and turn slip the first two sts pick up and k the empty slipped stitch slip the next st pick up and k the next slipped stitch and so on until you have 13 sts on your right needle on these 13 sts work the first sole strip exactly like you did the first strip for the back leg 1st row turn sl1 p12 2nd row turn sl1 k12 repeating row 1 and 2 work this strip until you reach your required foot length minus the toe since this strip goes in a 90 degree angle to the rest of the sock you can easily fold the heel flap in half and measure from edge to edge work until you have about 2 inches / 5 cms less than your total foot length if in doubt you should err on the side of caution you can make the foot longer at the end but you won t be able to make it shorter if you work too many row at this stage my sample sock had 80 row here but then again i wear a size 42/43 make a note of the number of row again for your record with an empty circular needle pick up and k a stitch in every slipped stitch down the left side of that strip to give you half the number of row in new sts in my case 40 sts now i am afraid we will need to do a bit of maths the next strip will contain the gusset decreases so you will need to determine how many sts you should start out with the total of your sole sts will be the amount after the heel turn 19 in this case plus the number of row for your heel flap 40 in my case 20 either side of the flap your first strip will use up 13 sts or your strip width + 2 and your last strip will use 12 sts strip width + 1 so if you subtract these from your total it will give you"
