  "notes": "these baby beavers work up fast and require only small amounts of yarn and little sewing, but still have cute details like a textured stitch used for the tail, and tiny toes giving a webbed look to their rear feet.\r\n\r\n**size**\r\nabout 11cm/3 ¼” long if made with the recommended yarns.\r\n\r\n**tools and materials:**\r\n* worsted weight yarn in light brown and dark brown\r\n* 3.5mm(e) crochet hook\r\n* 6mm black plastic safety eyes\r\n* optionally, a wire cutter to shorten the stems of the eyes\r\n* fiberfill stuffing\r\n* stitch marker, pair of scissors, pins, yarn needle\r\n\r\n**difficulty**\r\nthis pattern is suitable for intermediate level crocheters, who are confident with basic stitches (ch, sl st, sc, dc, working in flo/blo) and frequently used amigurumi techniques (invisible decrease, magic loop).\r\n\r\nhead, body (including popcorn st front legs) and tail are crocheted in one piece, so there is not a lot of assembly in the end - only the ears, nose, and rear feet must be sewn on.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is written in english using us crochet terminology (uk/aus equivalents provided). it contains many in-progress photos, but also includes a text-only appendix for easy printing, if you prefer working from a printed pattern but want to save ink and paper.\r\n\r\nfinished amigurumi made from this pattern are yours to keep or gift or sell, i only ask you to credit me as the designer in case you decide to sell them.\r\n\r\n> do the babies look a bit lost on their\r\n> own? my [busy beavers][1] pattern was\r\n> designed to round out the family: it\r\n> includes two differently posed\r\n> grown-up beavers, plus some foods to\r\n> share with the youngsters\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/busy-beavers",
