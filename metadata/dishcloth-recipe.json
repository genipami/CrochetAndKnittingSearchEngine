  "notes": "all kinds of \"recipes\" for a \"grandma's dishcloth\" have been jotted down and passed around for ages.  years ago, i was shown a trick of adding a two stitch short row on the two decrease corners.  in my opinion, it aids the gentle turn of those corners, making them sharper and helps the dishcloth to remain square.  \r\n\r\nthis type of dishcloth pattern has been free since the dawn of time.  i do not claim this as my own but would like to share the \"recipe\" of how i remember it being shown to me.  \r\n\r\nyou may distribute this one freely and sell the finished items, but please do not sell this written pattern, because... grandma would be highly disappointed with you!
