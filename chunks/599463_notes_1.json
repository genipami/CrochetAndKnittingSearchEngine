    "content": "this design is made of 2 hexagonal grannies joined together to form the body and sleeves and adding a hood while lengthening the sleeves and bottom to desired length it s a very simple concept that any level of skill can grasp and mold to their liking the size of the cardigan is based on the size of your hexagons this pattern was written based on the one i made for my daughter she wears a sm/med jacket and size 0 pants of course hook size will affect the size of your stitch but the real sizing comes from the size of the hexagons it is very easy to put your own twist on this project"
