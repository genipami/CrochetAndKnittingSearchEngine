    "content": "there has been some interest lately in using the crocodile stitch in a flower afghan block it is usually worked in row not rounds but the scales look so much like petals that using them in a flower seems an obvious step this variation on the original stitch is my attempt at incorporating this popular motif into a square worked-in-the-round afghan block to me it looks like a dinner-plate dahlia just beginning to open so that s what i m calling it the croco-dahlia however the petals and background may be worked in any color combination this 6 inch test block was made with caron simply soft collection worsted weight yarn and a size g hook the same pattern resulted in a 7 25 inch square with red heart super saver yarn and an h hook this pattern is available in both us and uk terms as well as in french **please join me on dunnica lane 1 if you have questions or need help with a pattern ** 1 http //www ravelry com/groups/dunnica-lane"
