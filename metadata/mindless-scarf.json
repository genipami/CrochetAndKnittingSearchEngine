  "notes": "it’s pretty simple really, and nice and mindless once you get the rhythm of it. this has been my go-to for when i need a project that requires little thinking. and, the result is quite nice, if i do say so myself.\r\n\r\nthis patterns works out to a pretty decent mid-size scarf. the purple and green scarves were made with caron simply soft, both just under a full skein. they each came to 4.5-5 feet long. change up your yarn and/or hook size to personalize it even more.\r\n\r\nhere are links to pictures of the first three rows, as i get a lot of questions about the first rows working up uneven.\r\nrow 1:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/nicoleross/7974094176/\r\n\r\nrow 2:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/nicoleross/7974090632/\r\n\r\nrow 3:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/nicoleross/7974087384/",
