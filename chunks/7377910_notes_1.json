    "content": "the usual method for crocheting pet hats starts with a crochet magic_ring creating a circular top in this easy crochet tutorial you ll learn a brand-new technique to make a pet hat using a rectangular top instead of the traditional circular one while the circular top is more suitable for pets with larger heads it often ends up being too wide and doesn t fit the head shape well on the other hand the rectangular top is ideal for pets with smaller head circumferences and it s easier to adjust the size to fit your pet s head this makes it a great option for pets of various sizes this method not only saves time by eliminating the need for sewing but also creates a snugger better-fitting hat for your pet s head no more bulky loose-fitting hats for reference my cats weigh around 4 3kg so using acrylic dk yarn creates a perfectly fitting hat for them however for this demonstration we re using cotton aran yarn which results in a slightly larger hat making it more suitable for cats over 5kg"
