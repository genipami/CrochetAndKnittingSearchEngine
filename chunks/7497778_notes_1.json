    "content": "this is definitely more of a recipe than a real pattern but easily customizable and if you wanted to you could use up all your scraps for the letters i would recommend a solid colour for the background the letters are sideways and may be hard to see especially if using mosaic technique unless one stretches out the cowl this could be a benefit - one could possibly then wear it to work the beauty is in the subtlety i am not a real designer so i have not given proper instructions for mosaic there are lots of youtube videos but basically you knit one colour at a time slipping the stitches that are the contrast colour this only works if the colours of the row can mostly be alternated slipping the few stitches that need to be stretched for the proper letter to be made you could certainly do the whole cowl in traditional stranded colourwork and the letters will then be more distinct this cowl was surprisingly a hit with all my friends which is why i decided to share it here"
