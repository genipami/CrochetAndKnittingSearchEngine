  "notes": "this pattern is free and always will be. i hope it inspires you. invite over some friends you haven’t seen in awhile and knit little kindnesses together with scraps from your stash. knit a little kindness for someone and drop it in the mail for them with a nice card to let them know you’re thinking of them. take your neighbor a little kindness and a plate of cookies. just give one to somebody and say, “hey, this silly little thing made me smile and i thought it might make\r\nyou smile, too.” because in the end, i don’t think anyone ever wished they hadn’t spent so much time on being kind.\r\n\r\nnow also available in german thanks to user raeubertoechterch. thank you martina!\r\n\r\nnote:\r\nthis pattern was previously only available as an in-the-round pattern, but as of march 2021 it has been updated with the option to knit flat on two needles."
