    "content": "released just in time for world wide knit in public day a simple but highly textured poncho that was originally designed and made just for myself with no intention of releasing the pattern however a couple of friends have convinced me otherwise so here it is ~~~~~~ **one size only** though with sufficient yarn you may wish to repeat some charts to make it larger/longer **gauge** not measured yarn is held one strand of each worked together i used the yarns listed above approximately 560 metres of athena now discontinued and 631 metres 3 balls of regia the neckline was worked solely in two strands of athena but i chose to occasionally work charts in two strands of the regia - hence the variation of meterage between the two yarns listed **needles & notions** 4mm circular needle in 40cm 60cm and 80cm lengths to accommodate stitch count cable needle tapestry needle **knowledge** ability to cast on and work in the round basic cables one short chart only m1 increases this pattern has not been tested but i have knit a second project without issue ~~~~~~ don t wish to work with two strands together just work in a single strand of dk or worsted weight instead which will require approximately half the meterage mentioned above a single colour is soooo boring - work each chart in different colours which is a great way to use up leftovers wish to make the poncho longer just repeat/continue your favourite charts ensuring the stitch count hasn t changed #thegippslandponcho"
