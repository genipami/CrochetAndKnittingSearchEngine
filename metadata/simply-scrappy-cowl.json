  "notes": "small, simple things, done with consistency and love, add up to outsized beauty. that’s a reliable recipe for creative work, and it’s the basis of this little cowl recipe i created. i posted a version of this design over on the curious handmade blog some time ago. people loved it so much i decided to turn it into an official pattern in my trademark percentage checklist style. so here it is!\r\n\r\nthe simply scrappy cowl is a super relaxing project. it’s ideal for new knitters or anyone who needs a little mental vacation: a bit of ribbing, then straightforward knitting in the round broken up by rows of eyelets. the result is a cosy, adorable cowl that makes the most of any yarn you use. \r\n\r\nit’s a wonderful stash-buster for those tiny yarn scraps, and it’s also a wonderful \"advent yarn calendar\" project, if you have bought or made a holiday countdown mini skein set. because each stripe only uses about 5 grams of yarn, it’s a quicker knit and less of a commitment than your average yarn calendar pattern. and you can make multiple cowls from the same set if you want to whip one up for yourself and then make one or more for gifts!\r\n\r\n**finished measurements after blocking**\r\napproximately 162cm/64” long, 64cm/25” circumference\r\n\r\n**yarn**\r\n24 x 5g fingering weight mini skeins. total: 120g (approximately 420m/460yds) of fingering weight yarn\r\n\r\n**needles**\r\n4mm (us6), 60cm (24”) long circular needles (or size to obtain gauge)\r\n\r\n**notions**\r\nremovable stitch marker\r\ntapestry needle\r\n\r\n**gauge**\r\n22 sts/30 rows = 10cm (4”) in stockinette stitch after blocking\r\nexact gauge is not critical but may affect the amount of yarn needed if different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/knitvent-window-one"
