  "notes": "this slouchy hat uses your lovely skein of sock yarn that you don't want to turn into socks.  the world wouldn't be able to see the gorgeous colors if they were hidden under pants or in boots!\r\n\r\nthe midas hat is provisionally cast on and knit in the round in stockinette, which,  i think, really showcases beautifully dyed yarn.  it features a folded brim to maintain the clean, all stockinette stitch without a rolled edge.  plus the brim is wide enough to cover your ears and keep them warm.  it uses an elizabeth zimmermann technique that helps keep the brim from flaring out, which can happen with folded hems.\r\n\r\nif you like my designs please join my ravelry group **[laura reinbach designs.][1]**\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/groups/laura-reinbach-designs",
