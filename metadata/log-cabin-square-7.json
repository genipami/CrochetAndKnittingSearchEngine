  "notes": "\r\n\r\nthe crocheted log cabin square is a crochet square that is constructed similarly to a log cabin quilt - starting with the centre square then building out from there around each side of the square. \r\n\r\nit is crocheted using a simple linen stitch that creates a lovely solid fabric, and gives the squares a good shape.  \r\nyou can make as many squares as you like, depending on how big a blanket you'd like to make. for me using a 4.5mm hook each square was approx 14cm x 14cm. (it won't matter if your squares are a bit bigger or smaller.)  \r\ni found that a 7 x 5 squares blanket was around a cot size and weighted approx 700g .  each square used around 20g of yarn for the whole square.\r\n\r\nthese squares are made using dk/8ply yarn, whilst i used indie dyed merino wool for mine, they are also great for using up leftovers and other small amounts of yarn.  you could use solid colours if you prefer, or a limited colour palette, or all the colours!\r\nlinen stitch shows off hand dyed speckled colours particularly well i think. \r\nthe blanket is made from individual squares that are joined together once you have enough for the size blanket you want. they can be joined either by hand sewing or crocheting the squares together.\r\n\r\nyou could also make a smaller, thinner, lighter square using 4ply yarn and a 3mm hook. \r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy making these squares, i found they were very addictive!",
