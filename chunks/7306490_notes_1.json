    "content": "i created this pattern because i wanted to knit some stretchy ribbed socks as gifts but i didn t want to mindlessly knit 2x2 ribbing for the entire length of a sock enter a better ribbed sock the combination of 2x2 and 3x2 ribbing creates a pattern that is easy to memorize while still being fun and engaging to knit this pattern is written for toe up socks with a heel flap and gusset a link to a calculator for gusset increases is provided in the pattern while stitch gauge is not really important for this pattern ribbing is very forgiving you will need to measure your row gauge to know where to start your increases this is super easy don t be intimidated by the measuring tape only two size circumferences are written in the pattern 64 stitches and 72 stitches but again this ribbed fabric will stretch to accommodate a vast majority of the feet you knit for and since the socks are knit toe up the foot length and leg length are completely customizable each size has its own pdf download for ease of reading please ensure you are reading the pattern for the size you intend to make you will need 1 100g skein of sock yarn a 32 or longer circular needle for magic loop in your preferred sock needle size a tapestry needle for weaving in ends a ruler or measuring tape for checking your row gauge the red sample socks size medium took 75g of knomad eggshell which is approximately 328 yards the grey sample socks size medium took 85g of knit picks hawthorne which is approximately 303 yards the yardage you use for this project depends on your gauge shoe size and how long you knit the leg for most feet a single 100g skein of sock yarn is more than enough please contact me with any questions or concerns about the pattern"
