  "notes": "wind spinners look lovely in your garden, balcony or terrace. when you attach it right, the wind spinner automatically twirls even in a slight wind. \r\n\r\nthis pattern has tapered ends. the pattern also explains how to make the wind spinner in such a way that speeds up the work and saves yarn.\r\n\r\ncan be made in many different yarn weights, which is why i haven't given a gauge or amount of yarn needed. the technique is the same regardless of how long you want your wind spinner to be. select a crochet hook that goes with your yarn.\r\n\r\nwritten pattern and a step by step video tutorial."
