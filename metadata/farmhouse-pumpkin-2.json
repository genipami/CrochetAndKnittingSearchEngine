  "notes": "this crochet pumpkin pattern is worked flat with an easy combination of basic stitches, so it’s the perfect choice for beginner crocheters. \r\n\r\nyou can whip up a few pumpkins for yourself, or make a whole patch of pumpkins to sell at craft fairs. either way, i know you’ll love this easy fall crochet project.\r\n\r\nconstruction: the pumpkin is crocheted flat in rows, then seamed to create a tube. then, the top of the pumpkin is gathered with a running stitch. after stuffing, the bottom of the pumpkin is gathered in the same way.  \\then, the stem is made and attached.\r\n"
