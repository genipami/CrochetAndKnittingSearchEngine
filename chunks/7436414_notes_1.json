    "content": "this is an extremely simple ribbed sock pattern intentionally written as a guide for those who are intimidated by the idea of knitting socks it s designed for those who can cast on and are comfortable with knitting and purling but maybe not much else thorough descriptions of what s happening while the sock is being constructed and links to free ad-free videos are included along with way too much instruction for the experienced knitter **it s my vanilla sock recipe boiled down to baby steps in the hopes it will help other knitters fall in love with knitting socks ** the 2x2 ribbed fabric makes these easy to fit to most any adult and with a little practice most knitters can learn to increase or decrease the number of cast on stitches if they need to make large adjustments in fit"
