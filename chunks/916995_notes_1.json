    "content": "this handy little crocheted basket design with handles is a spin off from my three little bowls pattern a quick and simple pattern this small basket uses three strands of aran or worsted weight yarns held together you could use three strands of the same colour or three different colours for a lovely variegated effect i love using multiple colours because each stitch is unique depending on how the strands of yarn fall in place i have used 3 x 50g balls of drops alaska 100% wool in the colours mustard 58 light grey mix 03 & off white 02 it s an ideal container for knick-knacks face towels hair accessories or small toiletries this little basket is also an ideal craft stall make sell empty or fill with treats as with most of my free patterns you re welcome to make these to sell either online or at craft fairs all i ask is that you include a small tag or piece of paper acknowledging that the pattern came from www mezzacraft com the pattern works up quickly and is an ideal stash buster"
