    "content": "after getting sucked into animal crossing new horizons i wanted to make some nook leaf coasters but there weren t any crochet patterns out there so i made my own these are super quick and easy to make with your leftover bits of green cotton yarn - you only need about 10-12 yards for each coaster with the 4mm hook and sugar n cream yarn it s 4 inches long between the widest points so it just fits a regular mug but some of the bottom of the mug is over the cutout part of the leaf if you want a larger coaster you may want to use a heavier weight yarn and/or go up in hook size you can buy the formatted one-page pdf to print out and mark off or you can use the free version on my website https //belindamakes com/crochet-patterns/nook-leaf-coaster/ make a bell coaster 1 to go with it 1 https //www ravelry com/patterns/library/animal-crossing-bell-coaster"
