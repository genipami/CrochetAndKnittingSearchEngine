  "notes": "such an iconic animal, so distinctive and with an aura of mystery and, wrongly assumed, spookiness and the macabre! \r\n\r\nyes - i'm fascinated by them but to look at them and study photos of them, what a difficult challenge to characterise in knit-form!\r\ntruly hope i've done it justice!!\r\n\r\nmy bat is knitted almost in one piece (as with all of my animals) and i decided on an easy-to-sew pair of felt wings, (bought felt sheet not 'felted')... i tried to knit some but the felt was just so perfect as you can shape it to really look like bat wings.\r\n\r\nhe's/ she's so fun to arrange in the house, barn or garden - ooh and i'd love to see a micro knit one!\r\n... and with plenty of time before halloween you'll be on target to knit a whole 'cauldron' (no wonder they have that spooky attachment!!)\r\n\r\nwithin the pattern i've given lots of detailed instructions on not only how to knit but also how to add the wings - i've also given you two variations:- with forelegs (cutesy) or without (anatomical more correct) - depends whether you feel he/ she needs a sweater or not!?\r\n\r\nyarn-wise - i've used stash drops alpaca but you can use any 4-ply/ 3-ply (or finer if micro) yarn, and i knitted mine on 2mm needles.\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy this little pattern and enjoy having her/ him hanging upside down around the place!\r\n\r\nclaire \r\nxx\r\n\r\n\r\nthere is also a little instagram reel here for you to see\r\n[follow this link][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.instagram.com/reel/cvedm67ibit/",
