    "content": "welcome to the stripey raglan cardi pattern this is the written supplement to the youtube tutorial available on my channel this is a top-down raglan cardigan with a built in button band and a 2 row stripe repeat in colour a and colour b the cardigan is designed in a batwing shape with a large amount of positive ease at the bust and with a tight ribbing panel at the waist for a cinched effect this is ideally a scrap busting project you can make this with a really wide range of different yarns the best yarn to use would be aran weight/10ply but each colour can be made up of thinner yarns held together such as 2x fingering/4ply yarns or 1x dk/8pl 1x lace/2ply weight you can also even out the thickness of the piece by having your colour a yarn be thicker than colour b when choosing your colours i would advise separating them out into two piles the easiest way to categorise them would be light vs dark but you could also separate them by colour eg blues vs yellows try to always have colour a be the darker shade of the two - it will help you count your stripes when knitting size 1 to fit up to 129cm/51in bust and up to between 76-120/30-47in waist size 2 to fit up to 146cm/57in bust and up to between 87-137/34-54in waist size 3 to fit up to 163cm/64in bust and up to between 98-154/39-61in waist to get the loose dolman style fit choose a size above which gives you some positive ease when you compare your measurements to the max measurement above if none of the sizes will give you positive ease please read the sizing modifications section at the back of the pattern i d love to see your makes so please feel free to tag me @loupystudio and #loupystripecardi if you post online please keep in mind that this is a free pattern and as such i will only be able to dedicate limited time to pattern assistance if you are struggling with this pattern or need more detailed instructions i would suggest purchasing a paid pattern from one of the many creators who have designed similar cardigans"
