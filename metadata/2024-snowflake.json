  "notes": "this is a quick crochet snowflake that can be hung on a christmas tree as an ornament, or hung in a window as a winter decoration.\r\n\r\nnotes: \r\n* i used a 3.125mm hook\r\n* i used lion brand 24/7 cotton in color\r\n  white.  this seems to be thinner than\r\n  dk weight yarn.  it also seems to be thinner than\r\n  other skeins of the same yarn in a\r\n  different color.\r\n\r\n"
