  "notes": "description from knitty.com:\r\n> calorimetry is a scientific term describing the measurement of heat lost or gained.\r\n>\r\n> knit hats are a wonderful way to block out the cold, but when you have long hair it usually requires wearing it down, not often the most comfortable option on a blustery day. this headscarf allows you to wear your hair up while keeping your ears warm and preventing heat from escaping from the top of your head.\r\n>\r\n> my friend meredith wears hers all around san francisco and is modeling it here on the big sur coast. this can be knit quickly for a last minute gift, and as it only   requires one skein of yarn you can afford to knit one for all of your friends."
