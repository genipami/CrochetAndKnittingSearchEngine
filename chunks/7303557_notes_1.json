    "content": "reading or crocheting for that matter often requires wearing a shawl to keep us warm but the pointy shape of a normal triangular shawl does not keep our backs warm this reading shawl was designed to cover the whole of the back without holes in the fabric making it extra warm and a simple design on the front to make it pretty there are no tassels for practical reasons making it the ideal shawl to create and wear during those long winter nights when we are reading or crocheting in bed or on the sofa"
