    "content": "go up or down a needle size to achieve the desired fabric socks tend to be worked with a gauge of around 8 stitches per inch 32 sts per 10 cms but there is a certain leeway built into this other than sweaters for example socks are knit with a negative ease meaning that they are worked smaller than the body they are meant to cover ensuring a close fit and a comfortable wear the rule of thumb is to knit the sock about an inch 2 5 cms smaller in circumference than the foot but since a fundamental characteristic of knitting is the ability to stretch it will not make a huge differ- ence if the sock is actually 0 8 or 1 2 inches smaller it is by no means one size fits all but a small variance will not make a big difference the most important consideration is to get the drape of the fabric right work too tightly and you will be left with a sock that is too rigid and feels restricting to wear work too loosely and the result is a sock that may droop and move too much or produce folds in your shoes wearing out too quickly as well it may sound like hollow comfort now but this is something you will develop an instinct for over time and the more socks you knit sock page 2 size a lot of the bigger yarn manufacturers that specialise in sock yarn have size tables that list the numbers of stitches you need for various sizes and the various elements of a sock these can look intimidating at first as there is a lot of information but to start off with all you need is the number of sts to fit around your leg i have found that the vast majority of adults will fall into the 60 64 or 68 sts category but the principle works for whatever number you decide to pick a sock worked on just 24 sts makes a cute little ornament for a gift while a 120 st sock would be great generous christmas stocking for the purpose of this pattern i assume a 64 st sock construction but feel free to use the correct number for your own / the recipient s size instead please note that this amount should be a multiple of 4 to help with the working of certain parts later on cuff for a regular cuff you would start by casting on the number of sts according to your chosen size i e 64 sts in my case as this cast on needs to go over the widest part of your heel it absolutely needs to be stretchy if the socks are intended to be worn i would always recommend a long tail cast on or its variant the twisted german cast on but feel free to use your personal favourite if you have one if you are planning to work the leg of"
