    "content": "using twisted stitches and a seed stitch rib the texture and ridges in this hat are as majestic as the mountain it is named after the directions are for a size small 21 circumference but the hat is easily adjustable if you love twisted stitches then you ll have a blast making this hat if you hate doing twisted stitches then do this hat so you can get more practice and eventually love doing them note on length the first time i made this hat i used red heart worsted yarn and only did 4 of the pattern repeats the second time i made it with lion brand worsted pictured above and i had to do 5 pattern repeats to get the same length so as you knit measure it at 4 repeats and if it s around 7 at that point then you might want to just do the final 4 row then before the crown shaping thinner worsted yarn though will take 5 pattern repeats"
