    "content": "skandium copyright \u00a9 general hogbuffer 2014 this design takes its main inspiration from the traditional scandinavian yoked sweaters particularly some of the famous icelandic lopi sweaters it struck me at some point that the typical way these yokes and their patterns are used to decrease the stitch count almost invisibly could very well work for the gusset part of the foot rather than decreasing 2 stitches every 2 rounds at the side of the foot a very similar shape can be achieved by decreasing 8 stitches every 8 rounds equally distrib- uted not only does this hide the decreases pretty well it also allows the pattern to be uninterrupted all around the foot size the downside of the principle behind this sock is that it involves a bit of math and for this reason i can only supply one size with 72 sts around the leg and foot over the stranded portion from experi- ence i would say that this is probably the size that most people will fit into with a bit of adjustment of the needle size and/or yarn thickness if necessary material there are various options to work the leg these will impact quite a lot on yarn usage i have knitted my sample socks with an 80 sts ribbed leg this takes quite a lot of yarn and with only 50 g of each colour to play with i decided to work the socks fraternal if you want to work this variation but with identical socks i would suggest you have at least 60 g of colour a to play with i have not tried any of the other variations and the length of the leg and the foot is obviously also a factor but for these i would guess 50 g of either colour should be just enough for most people gauge on my sample i was getting 33 sts x 45 row over plain stocking stitch with the smaller needles and 33 sts x 42 row over stranded stocking stitch with the bigger size needles but take this as a guide line only make sure that the sock fits you well and that you are happy with the drape of the fabric you are creating first of all needle size you will need needles in two consecutive sizes the size that you would be most happy to knit your chosen yarn with in a normal sock i used 2 5 mm and then one size bigger i used 2 75 mm there is scope here to adjust to your personal preference and to fine-tune the size of the finished sock use what works best for you i have written the instructions for circular needles and/or magic loop if you prefer to work with dpn s please note that needle 1 and needle 2 may mean different things for you other than that there should be no issues further requirements - tapestry needle - stitch markers although you could do it without if they irritate"
