    "content": "i knit a lot of socks i have a ridiculous amount of leftover sock yarn it s easy to use up the solid colored stuff in colorwork but what do you do with the variegated and striped yarn in trying to solve this dilemma i paired a bunch of relatively color-coordinated scraps with a single contrast color black by carefully using the solid color i was able to make the transitions between the different scraps of yarn look fairly cohesive and not muddy this pattern contains my personal vanilla sock recipe feel free to substitute your own favorite particularly if you prefer toe-up socks then use the charts and guidelines for transitioning between your various scraps **yarn requirements ** roughly 70-120 gms of fingering weight sock yarn depending on foot size using up scraps of yarn is **highly encouraged**"
