    "content": "the pattern is worked in single rounds so you will slip_stitch into the first stitch at the end of each round and chain to start your next round when you start your next round make sure you are putting your first stitch into that same space you just slip stitched into otherwise your finished product will be off if you prefer to use the invisible join method that works too you can find tutorials online i tend to use the invisible join only on the last round so it looks clean around the edge i suggest using bulky yarn or double stranding worsted yarn however i also included notes on how to increase or decrease the size as needed to fit your glasses if your basket is coming out too big or too small"
