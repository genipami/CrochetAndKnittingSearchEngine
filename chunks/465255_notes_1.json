    "content": "one of the most fun challenges about making a new pattern is taking an everyday object like a flower and trying to mimic its look its shape with a pile of yarn and a unique combination of stitches for this pattern you ll need to decide what colors you want your pansy to be i will add color change throughout the pattern to show you where you would change if you decided to change at that point but how many times you change colors will be up to you the more color changes you do the more yarn tails you ll be working around so i like to weave in my tails as i go i ve also modified my format a bit because it s easy to get lost in these instructions especially if you re a newbie small steps within rounds will be on different lines to keep things clear"
