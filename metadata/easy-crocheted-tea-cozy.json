  "notes": "keep your tea warm and practice your crochet skills with this super-\r\nfast and easy one-skein tea cozy. the single crochet ribbing\r\nstretches to fit many teapot shapes, and one skein of bulky\r\nweight yarn will see you through the project.\r\n\r\nthe tea cozy is worked back and forth, with an opening for the\r\nspout. the seam around the handle ensures a custom fit. this\r\npattern is appropriate for beginning crocheters. it uses american\r\ncrochet terminology and includes both text and charted\r\ninstructions."
