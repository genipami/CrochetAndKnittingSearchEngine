  "notes": "*or ex-girlfriends. old flames. former lovers. we collect yarn ends like stories of past paramours. this triangular-shaped shawl will let you use up those leftover ends to create one great story.\r\n\r\nalso, it tickles me to think of having random ex-boyfriends laying around the house, aspiring to be useful in a knitting project.*\r\n\r\nsize can easily be modified by adding or subtracting section repeats. \r\n\r\nas shown: 36 cm / 14” deep x 208 cm / 82” wide\r\nat largest points.\r\n\r\nusing needles with fine points will make the kfb’s and k2tog’s much easier - addi turbo lace needles are a great choice.",
