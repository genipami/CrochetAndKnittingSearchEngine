    "content": "i love the look of variegated sockyarn especially wollmeise in simple garter stitch and i love a little something around my neck when it s cold so i invented this pretty and practical scarf-shawl-hybrid it is shaped as a very wide triangle with 22 5-degree-angles at the tips rather than the usual 45 degrees it can be wrapped around several times and tightened with a knot so it will not leave you even if it s only 22 5 degrees fahrenheit that is outside a scalloped edge adds a little unexpected frill but is optional a very relaxing but interesting knit to enjoy every inch of your beloved wollmeise i used almost one entire skein 142 g of wollmeise about 550 yards so if you want to substitute yarns you will need about 550-570 yards of yarn just to be sure if you want to use less you will have to work fewer repeats and end up with a smaller sized scarf when downloading the pattern you can choose between the english the german and the spanish version thanks a lot to karinamaza for the translation i have uploaded a little **instructional video** on how to work the scalloped edge here 1 p s if you are not so fond of the scallops and looking for an alternative border you might want to check out my sharky-pie pattern 2 in which i provide instructions for a funky shark-tooth-edging that takes just two row to knit 1 http //www youtube com/watch v=b7fjqdc7ykg 2 http //www ravelry com/patterns/library/sharky-pie"
