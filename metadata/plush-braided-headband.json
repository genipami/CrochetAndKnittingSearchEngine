  "notes": "pattern overview\r\nthis plush headband with an unusual braid is stylish, classy and wide enough to keep your ears warm. the headband consists of three sections: a part with increases; a braid cable pattern (worked on 24 stitches), and a part with decreases. multiple finishing options are provided at the end. i made mine with a button so it’s easy to put it on and take it off without messing with my hair.\r\n\r\nsize\r\nthe sample shown is approximately 9 cm wide and 53 cm long. however, there is no set size - instructions in the pattern explain how to get the right length, using your own head as a gauge. the width of the headband will depend on your yarn, gauge and needles.\r\n\r\nyarn\r\nany aran or worsted yarn will work. the chunkier your yarn, the wider your headband will be. yarn used in the sample: moda vera daisy (10 ply, 62 meters used).\r\n\r\nneedles\r\nus 7 / 4.5mm - us 9 / 5.5mm needles. needle sizes are only a suggestion. this is knit back and forth in rows, so you can use straight or circular needles. sample is knitted with us 7 / 4.5mm needles. you will also need one cable needle for the braid pattern. \r\n\r\ngauge\r\n16-19 sts in stockinette. please note that the gauge in cables is tighter than in plain stockinette. example: the headband shown in the sample is only about 9 cm despite being knitted across 26 stitches.\r\n\r\nskills and techniques:\r\ncast on and bind off, knit, purl, decrease (k2tog, k3tog, ssk), increase (m1l, m1r), working yarn overs, working cables.\r\n",
