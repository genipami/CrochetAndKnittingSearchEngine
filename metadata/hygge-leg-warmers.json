  "notes": "i’m a firm believer that one can never have too many knits to layer up with. especially if you’re going to be tromping through the snow, leg warmers are a sure fire way to keep yourself cozy. these knit up quickly with an easy to follow textured repeat. knit them for yourself, or whip them up as a quick gift. the leg warmers should be knit with a bit of negative ease, to help ensure they stay in place when worn.",
