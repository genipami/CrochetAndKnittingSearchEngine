  "notes": "**this is a pay what you want pattern! use the code lilypad50 for 50% off the original price or use the code lilypad100 for a free copy. thank you for your support!\r\n\r\nelevate your home décor with the \"lily pad coaster\" crochet pattern, featuring a lovely ribbed texture and a delicate floral edging! perfect for both beginners and seasoned crafters, this easy-to-follow pattern adds a touch of whimsy to your coffee table while protecting surfaces from spills. with vibrant or muted colors, these coasters radiate positivity and make wonderful gifts or a lovely addition to your own collection. grab your yarn and hook, and create some cozy, handmade beauty!\r\n\r\nthis pattern is made in dk weight yarn with a 4.5mm hook. i think a synthetic or plant fiber is best for a coaster, as you will want it to be easy care. this coaster is worked in the round in dc st. you work increases every rnd with an easy ribbed repeat. you will add a floral edging on the last rnd. gauge is not crucial in such a small piece.\r\n\r\nthis pattern is written for one size which should be a perfect fit for most mugs. if you find that it is too small/too large for your mug, i encourage you to experiment with another gauge or the number of increase rnds.\r\n\r\nthis is a beginner friendly pattern, it uses basic stitches and includes a photo tutorial at the end of the written instructions. there are also links to video tutorials for all the special techniques.\r\n\r\nthank you for choosing my pattern. i hope you enjoyed it. you may sell as many of the finished items as you wish, but if you share on social media please give me credit @stopitharry on ravelry and link the pattern to its source. if you have any questions or need pattern support, please contact me @stopitharry on ravelry. i appreciate your support!\r\n\r\na huge thank you to my amazing testers [divavonpurl](/people/divavonpurl), [coffeebuddy](/people/coffeebuddy), [batty4yarn](/people/batty4yarn), [jani22](/people/jani22), [frasierknits](/people/frasierknits), [chickennanna](/people/chickennanna), [geeguess](/people/geeguess), [panacheplus](/people/panacheplus), [zippitydoodah](/people/zippitydoodah), and [fizzlllll](/people/fizzlllll)! you helped me so much in the process of bringing this design to life!\r\n\r\n"
