  "notes": "this simple hat is based on my ten stitch twist pattern and is worked in a spiral from the top down. you never have more than ten stitches on your needles and it is knitted in garter stitch throughout.\r\n\r\nmy hat was knitted with 80g of bramble dk and fits a large adult head. it could easily be made shorter if you don't want to turn up the brim or for a smaller head.\r\n\r\nall my ravelry patterns are free to download but, if you enjoy them,\r\nplease consider making a donation to the british liver trust where\r\nthe money will go to fund research and support the families of\r\nchildren with a liver disease. you can do this easily by going to my\r\nfundraising page [here][1]\r\n\r\nhappy knitting!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.justgiving.com/page/frankie-brown",
