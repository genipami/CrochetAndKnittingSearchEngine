    "content": "this is a simple ankle sock using blue moon socks that rock lightweight this is a very heavyweight sock yarn much closer to sport weight in my opinion so if you substitute and use a different sock yarn socks may turn out differently i would suggest to go down a needle size to make a more tight fitting sock with this weight yarn and if using a more conventional sock yarn e g lighter weight the sock will turn out smaller the pattern used ~80g of main color and ~20g of the contrast color this sock features a short row heel and a round toe errata please note that in row 5 stitch 2 is a knit stitch"
