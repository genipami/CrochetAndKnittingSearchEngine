  "notes": "this beautiful cowl makes a great gift and is a quick knit.  use up some stash yarns or buy a mini-skein bundle to mix and match.\r\n\r\nsample cowl used 1 skein of woolstok worsted in midnight sea plus 2 mini-skeins each of 4 colors from the holiday frost mini skein bundle.  you could also do a 2-color cowl with 1 full skein of 2 contrasting colors of woolstok.\r\n\r\nwith the mini-skein bundle, you would have enough for contrast colors on a second cowl as long as you're willing to mix up your colors.  you would need a second skein of your main color.  the possibilities are endless.  sample used 4 colors in the mini skeins and repeated the sequence 3 times.\r\n\r\nthe cowl can be made larger or smaller simply by altering the stitch count.  it needs to be a multiple of 4 stitches.  changing the stitch count will, of course, alter the quantity of yarn used.",
