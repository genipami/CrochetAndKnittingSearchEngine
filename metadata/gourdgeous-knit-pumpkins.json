  "notes": "fall decor has never been faster with the gourdgeous (gourds, get it?) knit pumpkins. any beginner can make these in no time, using only a knit tube or rectangle sewn into a pumpkin shape. each ball of recommended yarn makes 2 pumpkins. customize the look by switching up colors, yarn thickness and needle size, or stem material. \r\n\r\nphoto tutorial instructions are for both knitting flat or in the round.\r\n\r\nno gauge; finished pumpkin size depends on amount of stuffing. sample pumpkin is 6in wide and 3.5in tall.\r\n\r\n**materials**\r\napproximately 40 yds lion brand wool ease thick & quick (1 full ball makes 2 pumpkins), or equivalent super bulky yarn\r\napproximately 5 yds contrasting color yarn\r\nsize us15/10mm straight or circular knitting needles\r\nsize us9/5.5mm dpns\r\nstitch marker\r\npolyester fiberfill\r\ntapestry needle\r\nscissors",
