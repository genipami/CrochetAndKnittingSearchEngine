    "content": "the headband is knit back and forth in the english rib which is very warm and comfortable to wear it has a twist in the middle - not only this looks classy but it s also a clever way to hide the seam the size is easily adjustable for this project i chose an alpaca and wool mix that is warm and just a little fluffy the yarn is very soft and great to work with i used less than one skein"
