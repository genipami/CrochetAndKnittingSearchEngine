    "content": "this simple kippah can be made with a stripe as pictured or in a solid color this kippah is sized to fit most adults to make a slightly smaller version you can leave off a few row the two yarns listed are the ones i used for the pictured example you can use any similar-weight yarn you will want to make sure you have a very small tapestry/finishing needle for weaving in ends because this pattern makes for a very tight fabric my usual tapestry needle was comically large"
