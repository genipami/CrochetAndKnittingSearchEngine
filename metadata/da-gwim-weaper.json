  "notes": "don't fear da weaper... because they're pretty cute!\r\n\r\nfull disclosure: the idea for this amigurumi isn't mine. i originally saw the finished item on a facebook ad and thought i might challenge myself to see if i could work out the stitch counts and instructions for it.\r\n\r\nthe lack of a head (or face) means no fiddly embroidery or faffing around with safety eyes. if you're completely unco like me, this might work out really well!\r\n\r\n",
