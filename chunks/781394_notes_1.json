    "content": "this is a written pattern to make a gingerbread man softie it also includes pattern notes and pictures gauge is not important in this pattern you may use any yarn of your choosing the pattern gives the choice of dk or aran weight but using a different weight will simply change your finished size i recommend you use a hook a size or two smaller than the yarn packaging recommends as this will tighten your stitches and give a better finished look 50g of your main colour in a dk weight should be more than sufficient however whilst using the suggested aran weight yarn i found i needed 1 and half skeins of 50g aran paintbox yarns cotton thanks so much for your interest and i hope you have fun hooking your little christmas gingerbread men"
