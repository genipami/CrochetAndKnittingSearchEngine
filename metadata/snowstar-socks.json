  "notes": "\r\ni designed the snowstar socks with durasport yarn from canada's beloved woollen mill, [briggs & little][1], with a contrasting fluffy yarn, to give the socks a comfy-cosy feel.\r\n\r\nalthough this pattern is written for double pins, cuff-down, you can work it on circular needles, and toe-up. \r\n\r\nthe pattern is written for 64 sts, but you can customize the 8 stitch pattern repeat to 56 and 72 sts.\r\n\r\nthey're worked on 2.5 mm/us 1.5 needles, but you can go up or down, depending on the yarn you use. i used a sport weight yarn, but this pattern would be fine in fingering weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://briggsandlittle.com/",
