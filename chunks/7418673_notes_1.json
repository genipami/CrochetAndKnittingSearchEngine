    "content": "a small fun flag to celebrate pride inclusivity and human rights for all maybe it s more of an amigurumi than a flag as it has a face and a felt backing and some stuffing to pad the backs of the safety eyes finished size approx 3 inches x 2 5 inches if using fingering weight yarn use this as a pin or a fridge magnet or add a swivel hook to slip it on your backpack i found a few options for pride flags on ravelry but i found the intarsia/charted ones too fiddly i decided to make this by crocheting the rainbow rectangle first then the trans/bipoc colours second then attaching them together this pattern only takes a tiny amount of each colour my yarn was dollar store cotton that came in packs of 10 gram mini skeins super cheap you can use any weight of yarn and any hook as long as your gauge is tight enough to keep the filling in you need red orange yellow green blue and purple for the rectangle and white light pink light blue brown and black for the triangle extra black is needed for the border round a rectangle of black felt is used for the backing and black thread to sew the flag to the felt if you decide to use a different colour for the border i suggest matching the felt and the thread to your border colour for neatness i used 6mm safety eyes you could go bigger if that appeals or if you re using bulkier yarn and for stuffing you ll need a tiny amount of polyester fibrefill or yarn or fabric scraps and last but not least a crochet hook suitable for your yarn my prototypes used a 3 5mm hook but i could have gone smaller for a denser result you don t want stuffing poking out this is a video tutorial and i have put the written instructions in the description box under the video"
