  "notes": "materials\r\nto make one washcloth (bath mat), you’ll need…\r\n\r\n- 1 (8) ball(s) of purl soho’s [witch hazel][1], 100% pima cotton. each ball is 48 yards/ 50 grams; approximately 45 (384) total yards required. we used glacier blue and heirloom white for our bath mats and every color of witch hazel for our washcloths.\r\n- optional: us 8 (5 mm) [double pointed needles][2], to begin project if you prefer not to use magic loop\r\n- us 8 (5 mm), 24-inch [circular knitting needles][3], whether you’re starting with double pointed needles or doing magic loop\r\n- bath mat only: us 8, 47- or 60-inch circular needles (note: if you’re using magic loop, you can use just the 47- or 60-inch needles throughout, but they may be a bit unruly at the beginning of the project when you’re working only a few stitches!)\r\n- optional: a spare needle, one or two sizes larger, for binding off\r\n- a [stitch marker][4]\r\n\r\nand if you want to make a few color-coordinated washcloths, our [witch hazel bundles][5] include 3 or 9 colors of witch hazel!\r\n\r\ngauge\r\n14 stitches and 16 rows = 4 inches in stockinette stitch, unblocked\r\n\r\nnote: this is not the gauge of the finished project, but if you get this gauge for a flat swatch, your finished projects will end up roughly the right size!\r\n\r\nsizes\r\nwashcloth (bath mat)\r\n\r\n- finished diameter, unlaundered: 8 (24) inches in diameter\r\n- finished diameter, machine laundered: 7 (22) inches in diameter\r\n\r\nnote: when you run witch hazel through the gentle cycle of a washing machine and dryer, it shrinks a little bit and also gets denser, softer, and even more amazing!\r\n\r\ndesigned by purl soho designer, [gianna mueller][6]. see more of gianna’s designs [on her instagram][7]! \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.purlsoho.com/witch-hazel.html\r\n  [2]: https://www.purlsoho.com/tools-and-notions.html?collection_filter=23799\r\n  [3]: https://www.purlsoho.com/tools-and-notions/knitting-and-crochet.html?collection_filter=23796\r\n  [4]: https://www.purlsoho.com/tools-and-notions/knitting-and-crochet.html?collection_filter=964\r\n  [5]: https://www.purlsoho.com/witch-hazel-bundle.html\r\n  [6]: https://www.purlsoho.com/create/tag/gianna-mueller-for-purl-soho/\r\n  [7]: https://www.instagram.com/giannaknits/"
