  "notes": "please note that these are just my notes rather than a complete pattern. unfortunately there are no detailed instructions for the heel and the toe included in the pattern.\r\n\r\ndespite the simpliness of this pattern, i decided to share the notes as a pattern just to make things easier - i kept the notes on my project page for a while but i thought this might be a better way.\r\n\r\noctober 29, 2014: german translation now available. thank you [paiova][1] for the translation and greetings and thank you to the facebook group “stricken macht socken” (“knitting makes socks”)!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/people/paiova"
