  "notes": "**special note:** \r\n\r\nafter a long and courageous battle with breast cancer, my cousin connie passed away this afternoon, december 29, 2024.  this is a hard loss. \r\n\r\nconnie was a warrior of epic proportions, that fought cancer with every fiber of her being. connie never gave up and always had a ready smile and a huge heart that gave love freely, without hesitation.\r\n\r\ni hope that this is how you give this hat away when you make it for a cancer warrior...with love and freely given.\r\n\r\n\r\n**i hate cancer!**\r\n\r\nthis is a very simple design that i came up with for my cousin who was recently diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer.  her doctor is recommending that she sleep in a cap while going through chemo.  i think it is also versatile enough to be worn as a beanie.  it is super cute.  \r\n\r\ni made connie several in different colors so she could match it to her outfits, especially if she loses her hair. it is made to fit snug for comfort and warmth. \r\n\r\nfor those of you who are going through your own cancer battle…fight on!  for those of you watching a loved one go through this, being there is the most important thing you can do…and for those who are making and donating these hats to cancer warriors, and cancer centers…from the bottom of my heart…thank you!  \r\n\r\ncancer sucks!\r\n\r\nwhen you have completed your beanies, i would love to see them, so please share your pictures on social media and tag me or post a link to my pattern…i would appreciate it!  \r\n\r\nif you have any questions, you can find me on facebook at https://www.facebook.com/knottyleesa  and on instagram at https://www.instagram.com/leesasknottycorner  also, if you, want you can join my facebook group.  i would love to see you there.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/theknottycorner  \r\nleesa\r\n",
