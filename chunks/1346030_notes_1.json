    "content": "i designed this crochet top a few years ago now and it has quickly become a go-to in the summer months this top is the perfect opportunity to play with colour and use up some leftover yarn scraps from previous projects or just buy wonderful new yarn in lots of lovely colours although i have written the pattern with recommended adult sizes the top can be adjusted easily depending on the desired fit and sleeve style similarly the pattern can easily be adjusted to use different yarn weights/hook sizes than those specified in the pattern i would be more than happy to provide help adjusting the pattern to your requirements if so please contact me"
