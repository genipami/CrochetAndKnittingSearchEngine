  "notes": "the aiyu tee is a fitted summer crop top with flutter sleeves and lace edging details. the seamless set-in sleeve construction is designed for plant fibre yarn. typical set-in sleeve construction requires shortrows which creates unsightly holes if you are using plant fibres. this construction overcomes that problem. of course, you can also make the aiyu tee with animal fibre yarn if you wish.\r\n\r\nthe tee is worked top down, with optional waist shaping. you begin by knitting flat for the front and back neckline. then, stitches are picked up for sleevecaps. sleeve and body increases are done through a combination of knitting in the round and knitting flat. the body is knitted in the round. sleeves are picked up and knitted in the round.\r\n\r\n**skill level:** advanced beginner to intermediate. pattern involves lots of picking up stitches, putting stitches on hold, shortrows, and minor lacework.\r\n\r\n**garment bust circumferences**\r\nsizes: 1, 2, 3 (4, 5, 6) \\[7, 8, 9\\]\r\ncentimetres: 69.5, 79.5, 90 (100, 110, 120.5) \\[130.5, 140.5, 151\\]\r\ninches: 27.5, 31.5, 35.5 (39.5, 43.5, 47.5) \\[51.5, 55.5, 59.5\\]\r\nthe tee is designed to have about 4 cm (1.5 inches) of negative ease around the bust.\r\n\r\n**garment waist circumferences**\r\nthis only applies if you do optional waist shaping.\r\ncentimetres: 57.5, 68, 81 (91, 101.5, 112) \\[123, 135, 143.5\\]\r\ninches: 22.75, 26.75, 32 (35.75, 40, 44.25) \\[48.5, 53, 56.5\\]\r\n\r\n**suggested yarn**\r\nscheepjes stone washed\r\nsport weight\r\n78% cotton 22% acrylic\r\n130 m per 50 g ball\r\nsample is in 818 lilac quartz\r\n\r\n**yarn quantities**\r\nwith optional waist shaping: 4, 4, 5 (5, 6, 6) \\[7, 7, 8\\] balls\r\nwithout waist shaping: 5, 5, 6 (6, 7, 7) \\[8, 9, 9\\] balls\r\n\r\n**needles and gauge**\r\n3.5 mm, 10” or suitable small circumference circular needles for sleeve\r\n3.5 mm, 16” or suitable medium circumference circular needles for body\r\n3.5 mm, 32” or suitable large circumference circular needles for yoke\r\nusing 3.5 mm needles, in stockinette, 22 stitches and 30 rows = 10 cm by 10 cm swatch",
