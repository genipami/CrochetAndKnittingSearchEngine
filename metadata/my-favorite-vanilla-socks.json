  "notes": "**the story**\r\nwhen i started out fiendishly knitting socks i hated the gusset heel. all i wanted to knit was a short row heel sock from the toe up. having learned a gusset heel, and found one i love love love, i almost exclusively knit cuff-down socks with a gusset heel. they are my favorite tv time knitting... even when watching the walking dead (though nothing interrupts game of thrones). so here they are, my favorite vanilla socks. period.\r\n\r\n**materials**\r\n* fingering weight yarn; 400 yds per 100g\r\n* us 2 (2.75mm) 32-inch circular needle (or preferred length)\r\n* removable stitch marker (1)\r\n* stitch markers (2)\r\n\r\n**finished sizes**\r\n7½ (8½, 9?) inch circumference (recommended fit: 1-inch neg. ease)\r\n\r\n**gauge**\r\n30 sts and 42 rows = 4 inches stockinette in the round.\r\n\r\n**notes**\r\n* these socks are worked from the cuff down, feature a modified eye of partridge gusset heel and use the kitchener stitch to close the toe.\r\n* this pattern includes written instructions only. make 2 socks to\r\ncomplete a pair.\r\n* instructions are given for smallest size with additional sizes in\r\nparentheses. when only one set of instructions is given, it applies to all sizes.\r\n* slip all sts purlwise unless otherwise noted.\r\n* this pattern is written for the magic loop technique however any method of circular knitting may be substituted. in case of using dpns, assume that the front needle is synonymous with needles 1 & 2, and that the back needle is synonymous with needles 3 & 4.\r\n* **note:** if you use a lighter-weight sock yarn, such as 462 yds/100g, i recommend going down one needle size and going up one size in the instructions. for example: i knit a 56 st size sock on us 2 needles with 400 yds/100g yarn, but knit a 64 st size sock on us 1 needles with a 462 yds/100g yarn.",
