  "notes": "it's time for a lollygag!\r\n\r\nwe've paired a solid and shading yarn for this one.\r\n\r\nit's a cowl knit in the round like a tube and grafted. \r\n\r\nthis texture is created with a fun picked-up stitch. \r\n\r\nmain color and contrasting colors are switched halfway through to use as much of your yarn as possible!\r\n\r\nwould be beautiful with a variegated and solid too!\r\n\r\nif you have a kit from the shop, please check your pattern. there is a mistake. \r\nsection 1, round 12 should be worked with the mc, not the cc. \r\n\r\ngosh, designing patterns is hard:) we have one more mistake. we just updated the pattern 11/14. round 5 should end with 2 stitches, not 1. sorry!",
