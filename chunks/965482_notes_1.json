    "content": "the dolphins in the pictures were made in phil aviso the small one was made with a 3 5mm hook used up a little over one skein of yarn and is about 25cm long the larger one was made by doubling the yarn and using a 4 5mm hook it used up a little less than 5 skeins of yarn and is about 38cm long this pattern is free because it s easier for me to set up this way however instead of paying me you can take this opportunity to donate a small amount to your favorite charity or artist please do not sell or distribute this pattern or sell dolls made from this pattern if you share your work on social media a link back to the pattern page is appreciated important update if you ve downloaded the pattern before december 7 2025 then there is a mistake on round 30 i am so sorry it took me this long to double check it and figure this out the first 1sc should be 11sc at the end of the instructions of round 30 you should be 3st *past* the end of the round this is your new end of round the pdf has now been updated"
