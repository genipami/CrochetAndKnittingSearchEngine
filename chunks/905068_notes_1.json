    "content": "this is a little woodland mushroom that is knitted in one piece and can be completed in under 2 hours the idea for this specimen sprung from not having the right color contrast yarn and using tea to dye the mushroom cap made from the white yarn of the stalk you are of course welcome to skip the dyeing process altogether although i really ended up liking the effect for a more naturalist aesthetic check out the smaller clone version of this guy - mini earl grey mushroom errata row 1 of the stalk portion should read p2tog p2 * - a decrease instead of increase"
