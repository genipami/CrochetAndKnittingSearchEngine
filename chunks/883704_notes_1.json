    "content": "most mesh market bags are crocheted in the round and will stretch lengthwise when you put things in them often getting narrower in diameter at the top as well this bag was inspired by a wonderful 40-year-old non-crocheted string bag that was given to me the pattern is crocheted as a square mesh which is then gathered at the opposite sides to form the front/back and left/right sides the result is a bag that mostly stretches in width diameter and much less in length no more bag stretching to your knees when you put something in it worked with cotton crochet thread it is lightweight and easily portable size empty & unstretched 13 x 16 not including handles approximately the bag is very stretchy the usual stuff applies - feel free to sell anything you make using this pattern but don t sell the pattern itself please don t post it link to it instead or claim it as your own most importantly have fun and post your project photos"
