    "content": "this pattern uses a distinctive pattern stitch it looks as though it might be uncomfortable but absolutely isn t on the leg i didn t continue the pattern on the instep but that could easily be done i enjoy the way the pattern works out with self-striping yarn as first one color and then another is emphasized in the reverse stockinette bands"
