    "content": "increases accommodate that it is a simple increase two 2 single_crochet in next st side by side each round but the increases of the following row are centered over the previous increase see crudely hand- drawn chart below work enough increases to go from the heel of your hand to that big bottom thumb joint the number of increase rounds will vary depending on hand size you will probably need to work a few more rounds without increases after that until you get to the webbing between your thumb and index finger hand once you get to that webbing area you are going to have to chain a few to span the gap from the back of the glove to the front of the glove and you are also going to have to skip a number of stitches to allow for the space your thumb will go through only you know what will work best and it might take a tiny little bit of trial and error i would suggest chaining 3-5 stitches and eyeball how many stitches you need to skip make sure that these skipped stitches are more or less centered over your gusset increases from before single_crochet in that next stitch and then single_crochet around the bigger hole skipping the thumb hole and single_crochet ing in the back loop of each of the chains that created the thumb hole keep trying on the glove to get the rest of the finger holes right continue to single_crochet in the spiral until you get to the next finger which should be the pinky hole and this time you want to make your chain so that it joins from the front of the glove to the back it ll be easier to continue working in the spiral for the pinky hole you may only want to chain 3 again depending on hand size skip the number of stitches that seems right when you eyeball it single_crochet in the next stitch and continue to single_crochet in the spiral and 1 single_crochet in the back loop of each pinky chain until you get to the spaces between your remaining 3 fingers which should be at about the same level fingers this is where it s going to seem a little funny because at this point we still have not cut the yarn i like to avoid weaving in ends wherever possible if your next chain is going to be between the middle and index finger make it from the back of the glove to the front if it s between the middle finger and the ring finger have it go from the front to the back whichever way you end up doing the middle finger is going to be the first finger you do hence the funny because yes i m apparently 12 years old single_crochet in the spiral until you re 2 rounds from the fingertip then decrease in the spiral until the opening is too small to bother with cut"
