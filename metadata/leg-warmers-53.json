  "notes": "this pattern is super flexible and easy to follow (trust me this was my first knitting project!!), you can add or remove stitches and rows as needed to get desired width and length\r\n\r\nthis pattern can also be worked flat and sewn together at the seam\r\n\r\n10 ply worsted yarn can also be used with 5 mm needles and casting on 48 stitches\r\n\r\nthis pattern should be easy to understand and make, but if you get stuck, please don’t hesitate to message me with any questions you may have about this or any of my patterns :)",
