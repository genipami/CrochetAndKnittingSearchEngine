    "content": "hexagonal hooded cardigan knotty fashions by celeste\u00a9 this design is made of 2 hexagonal grannies joined together to form the body and sleeves and adding a hood while lengthening the sleeves and bottom to desired length it s a very simple concept that any level of skill can grasp and mold to their liking there are plenty of tutorials all over the internet and you tube for cardigans of this type in various forms some with collars some without some with hoods and sleeves that are cuffed this was made from a picture seen on the internet the size of the cardigan is based on the size of your hexagons this pattern was written based on the one i made for my daughter she wears a sm/med jacket and size 0 pants of course hook size will affect the size of your stitch but the real sizing comes from the size of the hexagons so there isn t a real exact pattern but more of a guideline especially when it comes to changing colors it s really up to you when to change if you are using multiple colors i will be as exact as i possibly can but feel free to play with the guidelines it is very easy to put your own twist on this project as far as supplies goes it is really up to what look you are going for for example using a smaller hook like a c d e with a lightweight yarn like mercerized cotton will require more rounds to achieve desired size but will give a more flimsy more delicate look and feel to the cardigan than using rhss and a size h or i hook like me which will give it a more bulkier and heavier feel to the cardigan again this pattern allows for a lot of individual creativity and freedom so play around and have fun i used what i had in my scrap stash and purchased 2 additional colors the regular blue & purple in mine was a rhss 7oz and i used them the most and still had yarn leftover sorry i cannot be more accurate with the amount of each color hook size used was h/8-5 00mm stitches used chain- chain slip_stitch- slip_stitch double_crochet- double_crochet half_double_crochet- half_double_crochet the hexagons are worked in a round make a magic_ring ch3 counts as 1st double_crochet now and throughout the pattern 2dc ch2 * 3dc ch2* repeat from * to * 4 more times sl st in the top of beginning ch3 slip_stitch in the next 2 double_crochet slip_stitch in the ch2 space r2 ch3 2dc ch3 3dc in the ch2 space ch1 * 3dc ch3 3dc in the next ch2 space ch1* repeat from * to * 4 more times slip_stitch in the top of beginning chain 3 slip_stitch in the next 2 double_crochet slip_stitch in the next chain space if you are using multiple colors change color with last slip_stitch so your beginning chain 3 of next round"
