    "content": "i made my first shawls with a 1-row knitted border this creates a nice corded effect at the edge it works if you pick up your stitches right at the edge otherwise you ll see the twisted yarns before you start the whole edging you could use some scrap yarn to do a little test on the edge where you have the twisted yarns if you like how it looks then use this option if not maybe try one of the others work the body of the shawl until you are ready to stop and have enough yarn to work around the outside twice use the longest circular needle you have or even two in the same size to hold all of the stitches if you only have one circular needle you ll need to squash up all the stitches you may find it easier if you use an extra double-pointed needle to pick up the stitches in the corners you can then transfer them to the circular needle just be sure they are all even once on the circular needle \u00a9 susan ashcroft 2012 - for personal non-commercial use only just knit it 3 1-row knitted border set-up row \uf0b7 work 1 row in the border colour this will be the top of the shawl \uf0b7 pick up one stitch in the corner place a marker to identify the corner stitch \uf0b7 pick up stitches down the side i do this by poking the needle through and wrapping the yarn around and pulling through - the equivalent of picking up and knitting all in one i picked up one stitch for every row two per ridge - see photo \uf0b7 when you get to the end of this side pick up a stitch or several stitches for the tip only one if you want it pointy place a picking up stitches marker to identify the center stitch \uf0b7 pick up stitches all along the second side in exactly the same way as you did for the first side bind-off row \uf0b7 now turn your knitting so that you are on the wrong side \uf0b7 knit 1 stitch kfb bind-off * the next stitch \uf0b7 now use basic bind-off knitwise to bind off until the stitch before the first marker kfb bind-off that stitch \uf0b7 remove the marker kfb bind-off the next stitch \uf0b7 continue with basic bind-off knitwise to the stitch before the second marker \uf0b7 work 2x kfb bind-off in this corner the same way as you did in the other corner \uf0b7 then work basic bind-off until you get to placing the back loop back on the lh needle the last stitch kfb bind-off this stitch and then use the yarn end to join the stitches neatly *kfb bind-off perhaps not its technical name \u263a bind off one stitch knitwise then insert the needle knitwise into the bound-off stitch to place the back loop of the stitch back onto the left hand needle knit into the back"
