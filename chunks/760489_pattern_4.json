    "content": "how to make a floating double_crochet is to explain how to do each section as a separate little lesson therefore we will start by isolating the technique involved in making the center ring section or floating ring as it will be referred to from now on it is important to understand that a floating ring is not a stitch in itself for this lesson you re just learning how to make the section of the floating double_crochet that acts as the center ring and ignoring the other section of the floating double_crochet for now so please understand that you will never be required to make a floating ring all by itself as is done here the intention of this lesson is to provide you with a specific skill that is easy to understand and practice don t worry if you are not understanding the relevance of all this right now just focus on learning the following technique and as you progress to the next lesson it will become clearer how all this falls into place floating ring step-by-step put aside the motifs you have been working on and attach a fresh length of yarn to the hook with a slip knot step 1 yarn over yo hook step 2 with thumb and forefinger pinch the yarn very close to the hook as shown just underneath the shaft the idea is to pinch the yarn slightly away from the hook just enough so that it creates a little bit of slack before the next yo you are about to do 7 step 3 yo hook again you now have 3 loops on the hook but because you are pinching the yarn slightly away from the hook there should be a bit of bagginess underneath the hook between the 2 yo s let s call what you are pinching a baggy loop it is vitally important that you not let go of this baggy loop otherwise you might lose it next comes the trickiest part of the technique it s tricky because you now need to make a second baggy loop whilst maintaining your hold on the first one step 4 release your pinch a little bit gather in the yarn and pinch it together with the baggy loop step 5 yo you should now have 4 loops on the hook and you should be pinching 2 baggy loops together 8 step 6 continue pinching the baggy loops and draw the yo you just made through 2 loops on the hook floating ring complete important even though the floating ring is complete don t be alarmed about having 2 loops left on the hook at this point this is how things are supposed to be we ll deal with the extra loop later on discussion let s take a little time-out here to put all this into context at this stage of the process you can see that the floating ring has been made by securing the 2 baggy loops into a"
