    "content": "and join the ends if you are creating the doubled cowl or mobius scarf for the mobius scarf twist one end of your scarf before joining to create the twist see photo you can join the ends by crocheting them together with a slip_stitch or by sewing them together with a yarn needle if making the long scarf you can choose to add fringe or leave it plain if fringing i find it easy to wrap yarn around a book or card that is approximately one inch longer than the fringe i want cut along one end of the yarn only and then lift off the number of strands that you want in each fringed section pull these through the end of the scarf as a small bundle using your crochet hook continue doing this along the edge of the scarf the thickness of the bundle and the spacing is entirely your own choice it is important to pull the fringe through the scarf from the same direction each time so that your knots face the same way trim to size and enjoy wearing it lots of videos online i d love to see your finished projects please tag me on instagram @crochetscot and add #crochetscot to your posts thanks enjoy making and wearing your lovely new scarf copyright \u00a9 2025 @crochetscot please do not claim this pattern as your own do not copy rewrite or redistribute in part or fully you may sell any item you make using this pattern if it is not mass produced always credit @crochetscot as the designer"
