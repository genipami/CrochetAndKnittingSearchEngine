  "notes": "this pattern is an adaptation of the 6-day star blanket by betty mcknit.\r\n\r\nthis pattern creates a slightly more than circular star-shaped skirt with an opening to wrap around your christmas or holiday tree. it has nine points (it is more than circular so two of the points are overlapping in the photo.) if you would like to make a tree skirt without the opening and just a hole in the center to put on an artificial tree, you can use the original 6-day star, superstar or supernova patterns and make an opening in the center by chaining 26, work one round of sc, and then pick up the pattern on setup round 3.\r\n\r\nthere are tree skirt adaptations with openings for the 6-day superstar and the 6-day supernova as well. \r\n\r\nfinished size: approx. 32” across, easy to upsize.\r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\nyarn: 1100 yards of #4 worsted weight yarn in holiday colors (or more of colors a and b for a larger tree skirt)\r\n\r\nshown in\r\ncolor a: big twist value emerald green\r\ncolor b: big twist twinkle red\r\ncolor c: big twist value white\r\n(one skein of each)"
