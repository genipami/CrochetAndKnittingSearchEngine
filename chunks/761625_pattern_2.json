    "content": "pompom 1 cut two circles of card the diameter of which will be slightly bigger than the size of the finished pompom cut a smaller hole in the centre of each circle about half the size of the original diameter the larger this hole is the fuller the pompom will be but if you make it too large the pompom will be oval shaped instead of round 2 holding the two circles together wind the yarn evenly around the ring using several strands at a time for speed until the ring is completely covered as the hole in the centre gets smaller you may find it easier to use a sewing needle to pass the yarn through 3 cut all around the yarn at the outside edge between the two circles using a pair of sharp scissors make sure all the yarn has been cut 4 separate the two circles slightly wind a double strand of yarn between them and tie firmly into a knot leaving sufficient length for sewing the pompom in place pull the two circles apart and fluff out the pompom to cover the centre join trim around the ends of yarn to produce a smooth edge"
