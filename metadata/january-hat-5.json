  "notes": "what’s better than a free hat pattern? 12 free hat patterns, of course! this year we’re releasing a new, free hat design each month made in germantown.\r\n\r\nthe first design is the january hat by our very own courtney kelley. the january hat features integrated ribbing, large diamond cables, and many, many delightful bobbles. a pom pom tops it all off and a cute custom kw tag completes the look.\r\n\r\nin conjunction with the release of the designs, we're also offering limited kits that include a custom leather tag, yarn for sewing the tag on (in both contrast and matching colors), and one skein of germantown in the recommended color. [find the kit on our site here][1] or ask for it at your favorite lys!\r\n\r\n**worthy of note**\r\nthe january hat is worked in the round from the bottom up. due to the traveling cable, starting with round 3, the beginning of the round shifts to the right one stitch on odd numbered round for the first 12 rounds. the beginning of the round then shifts back on odd numbered rounds 15–25, then back again for the top decreases. the shift is written into the pattern and the marker should always fall before the ‘k2’ of the first diamond cable motif. \r\n\r\n**specifications\r\nyarn**\r\nkelbourne woolens germantown (100% n. american wool; 220 yds/100 gm skein): sage 340, 1 skein.\r\n**gauge**\r\n1 patt repeat (18 sts and 28 rnds) = 3.25” (8 cm) wide and 4.75” (12 cm) long, after blocking.\r\n**needles**\r\n1 – 16” (40 cm) us 6 (4 mm) circular. \r\n1 – 16” (40 cm) us 7 (4.5 mm) circular.\r\n1 – set us 7 (4.5 mm) dpns.\r\n*check your gauge and adjust needle size(s) accordingly if necessary.*\r\n**notions**\r\ndarning needle, stitch marker(s), 2 cable needles.\r\n**size**\r\n16.25” (41.25 cm) circumference, unstretched, 8.75” (22.25 cm) height.\r\n**skills**\r\nknitting, purling, cable patterns from charts, bobbles.\r\n\r\nimage: linette kielinski\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://kelbournewoolens.com/onlineshop/year-of-hats-kit-january",
