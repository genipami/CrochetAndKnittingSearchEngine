    "content": "this pattern is a basic crochet in a flat circle i wrote out this pattern after trying the crochet cat bed by shawna anweiler 1 and finding it lumpy even after blocking the main difference is this is not a continuous chain and it does not use eyelash i was looking to make a fast cheap bed for rescue cats this bed does not need to be blocked the photos show that the bed can be used in two configurations first the way it is made gives sides that curve in the sides collapse easily when a cat flops against it second if you turn it inside out it makes nice straight sides that are more resistant to collapse i like to turn it inside out after it is complete the last photo shows the small bed holding a 9 lb cat these numbers may be adjusted after the beds undergo testing by the cats of the purebred specialty cat rescue small is for a cat up to 8 lbs a larger cat will fit inside but will collapse the walls upon stretching out medium is for a cat up to 14 lbs large is for a cat up to 20 lbs 1 http //www ravelry com/patterns/library/crochet-pet-bed"
