  "notes": "here is a pattern for a stylish, yet easy to make, ribbed hat.\r\n\r\nthis pattern works up really quickly and is ideal for crocheters of all levels. gauge is not important with this pattern, it is more important to measure the width and height of the hat required. \r\n\r\npattern also includes a photo tutorial, written instructions and a chart for the different sizes.\r\n\r\ni used dk yarn when making this hat but as gauge isn’t important, you can use any yarn as long as you match the recommended hook size for the yarn that you choose.\r\n\r\nthis is a digital copy of the pattern, not the finished product.",
