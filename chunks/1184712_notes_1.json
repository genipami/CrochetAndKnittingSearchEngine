    "content": "the crochet baby shower blanket is a nice easy repeat once you get moving along with it with a bit of texture it has enough detail to keep you engaged with the project this blanket looks great in solid colours so you don t need to mess around with colours but you can opt to change the colours in different rounds to make certain elements pop off the blanket the blanket is 38\u2033 x 38\u2033 square the lovey size is 24\u2033 x 24\u2033 it has some easy popcorn stitches combined with faux popcorn and v-stitches to tempt your texture desires lovey size for parents on the go sometimes a child cannot part with their blanket but an option is to make a lovey size it s a miniature sample my brother as a young boy couldn t part with his blanket without a lot of fuss and it was always a chore to drag it with us the lovey can be made with the same yarn so it gives the illusion that it s the same blanket this blanket is pretty fast to crochet and there is a specific note in the pattern to watch for keep an eye on rnds 10 and 11"
