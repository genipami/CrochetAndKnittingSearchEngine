  "notes": "this pattern is a fantastic stash buster!\r\n\r\nmake your crochet stripy giraffe with medium weight yarn and a 4 mm (g) crochet hook for a finished giraffe measuring approximately 19 inches x 12 inches wide. i used 12 mm safety eyes on my worsted weight giraffes (i've crocheted 3 now!). \r\n\r\nthis is still my daughter's favorite crocheted toy!\r\n\r\nthis pattern was designed by emma dent. emma dent has retired her i love buttons blog and she has transferred the pattern to the oombawka design crochet blog. the pattern is now available at oombawka design crochet.\r\n\r\n> thanks for all the lovely comments he has had. emma :)\r\n\r\n© 2023, oombawka design crochet. all rights reserved. you may sell finished items you crochet from this pattern. no part of this publication may be reproduced, altered, or distributed in any form, or by any means, without express written permission from rhondda mol."
