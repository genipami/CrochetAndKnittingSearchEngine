    "content": "this is one of my favourite classic patterns i cannot find the origin of this pattern but it seems like it s the one pattern that has transcended generations of knitters most knitters have made one of at some point and they are loved by knitters and non-knitters alike in fact when i was still doing craft shows and markets my dishcloth sets were my best seller they are one of my favourite quick knit projects and are a super affordable project costing only about $1 50 per cloth i use them all over the house for all sorts of cleaning projects they also make a great gift for the eco-conscious friend on your list as they are machine washable sturdy and reusable what s not to love and with tons of colour options available in cotton yarns such as bernat handicrafter you can match your kitchen decor grab your favourite colour and even match the holiday or season again this is my version of a classic pattern available for free on my blog"
