    "content": "these socks are easy to knit and are a good starting point for anyone who would like to try toe-up technique for the first time a simple garter rib tramline climbs up both sides of each sock adds interest and works well with plain variegated and striped yarns 100g/400m of 4ply/fingering/sock weight yarn is more than sufficient for either size many thanks to schwefelfell person for providing the german translation"
