    "content": "these mittens showcase a highly textured ribbed chevron fabric which i designed when looking for a chevron stitch pattern that would be elastic enough to give a good fit at the wrist and the hand too while maintaining the overall pattern the 4 row stitch pattern is easy to memorize and the result is an extremely elastic and wonderfully squishy fabric the thumb gusset is constructed in an unusual way omitting the decreases in the chevron pattern instead of working increases the top edge features a little bit of short-rowing to achieve a straight edge and prevent flaring the original pattern was for a women s l for a hand circumference of 19 to 20 cm i have now added a size m for hand circumferences of about 17 5 to 18 5 cm the stitch pattern is very elastic so the mittens will easily fit hands a little bigger or smaller as written the pattern requires about 220 m of sportweight yarn to highlight the texture use a solid or semi-solid color treat these mittens as you would treat lacy handwarmers the yarn is tightly plied but it still is merino alternatively you could knit the slipped stitches on the palm but i haven t tried this myself"
