    "content": "this yarn cozy is the perfect project for a first-time brioche knitter who wants to try two-color brioche knitting in the round it is also a great way to use leftover yarn since it uses very little yarn dig into your stash and find some nice contrasting colored yarns the pattern contains instructions for the bowl knitted in worsted weight yarn as well as in fingering weight yarn held double the cozy is knit top down **note ** brioche stitch creates a rather loose and lofty fabric which is why it is recommended to go down a needle size or two from what the yarn suggests start knitting with a us 6 4 0 mm needle and see how that works for you"
