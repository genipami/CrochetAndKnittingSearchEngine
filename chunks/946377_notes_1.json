    "content": "cute little round cloth that is knit in garter stitch with a lacey edge it combines two of my favorite patterns grandmother s favorite and the almost lost washcloth the washcloth knits up quickly and can be adjusted to make it larger or smaller gauge is not important simply choose the needle size that gives you the fabric you like i think this pattern looks best when you use variegated colorways you can get two cloths out of one skein of cotton yarn with some to spare great way to use up odds and ends"
