    "content": "below 2 on the first foundation row you will begin a hexagon work to the breakaway point for that hexagon then start a new hexagon continue working partial hexagons in this way from left to right until you reach the required number for the row return row are worked from right to left and this is where you finish off the hexagons that you started in the previous row except for the last hexagon of the row joined foundation row are worked as for the first foundation row but this time you will be joining each new hexagon to the row below continue alternating between a joined foundation row then a return row until you have 8 row of hexagons the last step is to finish the left edge this is where you complete the 8 unfinished hexagons that are positioned along the left edge of the shawl hexagons the hexagon motifs that make up this shawl each consist of 6 wedges the wedges can be crocheted in 4 different versions with each version taking up a lesser amount of positive space within a hexagon therefore when 6 wedges of the same type are combined within a hexagon they will affect the overall appearance of the hexagon ranging from mostly solid to almost empty to get the fade effect of the shawl you will start by working 2 row of hexagons that are the most solid in appearance then 2 row of hexagons that appear slightly less solid and so on for a total of 8 row of hexagons worked lengthways for the trapezoid silhouette of the shawl work 1 less hexagon on each row working the wedges when working the stitches for a wedge you will be inserting the hook into the indicated pull-throughs that were formed as you worked the loops off the hook for the previous stitch some stitches require you to insert the hook into the same pull-through more than once double_crochet/double_crochet and double_crochet/single_crochet are special stitches that enable you to work 2 row at a time to do this you will be inserting and pulling up an extra loop before finally working the loops off the hook when locating the pull-throughs keep in mind that the first pull-through could be in either the same place as the previous double_crochet or in the previous double_crochet/double_crochet the second pull-through is always on the trtr which eventually gets used twice please see the video tutorial for a demonstration of these stitches 3 instructions unless otherwise stated all stitches are worked into the current floating ring 1st row of hexagons first foundation row 1 first hexagon ftrtr w1 ch2 trtr w1 ch2 3 times 4 wedges made breakaway to next hexagon 2 for the next 24 hexagons ftrtr w1 ch1 slip_stitch in next ch2 space behind hook ch1 trtr w1 ch2 3 times 4 wedges made breakaway to next hexagon until a total of 25 hexagons have been started for the row return row 3 on current hexagon trtr"
