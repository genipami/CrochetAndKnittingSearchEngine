  "notes": "winter ice is a crochet one-skein lace shawl with a beautiful drape, using approx. 400m of fingering weight yarn. one beautiful skein of yarn is all that is needed to show off this very pretty and lacy triangle shawl/scarf pattern in an easy 2-row repeat.\r\n\r\nmade using basic crochet stitches that combine to create an interesting pattern, that is relaxing and quick to crochet.\r\n\r\nthis pattern is very versatile and you can make this shawl bigger by using more yarn and adding more rows. you could also use a heavier weight yarn (light worsted/dk) and a matching hook and it would work beautifully! blocking your shawl is very important to open up the pretty lace stitches.\r\n\r\n**measurements**\r\n\r\nshawl measures 66 in [168cm] wide x 25 in [63.5cm] depth\r\n\r\nyou can find a free version on my blog"
