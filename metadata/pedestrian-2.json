  "notes": "there are a lot of basic or vanilla sock patterns out there. this is the one i use for myself.\r\n\r\nthis pattern makes a top-down sock with a slipped stitch heel flap and a flat toe, worked on double pointed needles. \r\n\r\nyou can knit the leg and top of the foot either in stockinette stitch or ribbing.\r\n\r\nthis pattern is given in several stitch counts: 56, 60, 64, 68, and 72 stitches for either fingering or sport weight yarn. socks are pretty personal, so you’ll need to find the happy medium between your yarn, needles, gauge, and leg/foot size for the best fitting socks. \r\n\r\nyou'll need 300-400 yards of sport or fingering weight yarn, double-pointed needles in a us 1 or 2 (or the right size for your gauge) and a tapestry needle to graft (kitchener stitch) the toe closed.
