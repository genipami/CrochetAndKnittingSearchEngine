  "notes": "colourful little jumper that is perfect for using up scraps or mini skeins. the neckline is nice and stretchy. the construction is not too difficult and very versatile.\r\n\r\nthese colours are all potluck ™, but i'm sure you could come up with an even better combo. find an awesome combination of colours that makes you happy!"
