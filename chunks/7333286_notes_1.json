    "content": "this cute mini tapestry with a colorwork acorn design is worked in row from the top down and is perfect for confident beginners to crochet color work three colors of dk or worsted weight yarn are needed although only two are used at a time it is based on half_double_crochet which works up quicker than single_crochet based tapestries and allows for bobbles to add some interesting texture around the edges it s finished off using a wooden dowel and some fringe gauge is unimportant for this project provided that the different colors of yarn used do not produce significantly different gauges"
