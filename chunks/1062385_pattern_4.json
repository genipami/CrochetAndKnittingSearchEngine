    "content": "shoulder to travel under the arm and create the armholes start your next single_crochet row like all previous single_crochet row with a ch1 and turn single_crochet until you reach the ch1 space single_crochet in the ch1 space now you will need to create a row of fsc to connect to the next corner achieve this by ch1 and then inserting your hook into the chain left over from your previous single_crochet there are several excellent video tutorials on creating a fsc if you need to learn the rest of this technique you could also use a chain here but i cannot guarantee it will have the same effect as i did not attempt this method the example sweater used 8 fsc to connect each shoulder but you can adjust this count based on the size of the armhole needed keep playing with this count until the armhole is neither too tight nor too loose single_crochet in the next ch1 space then continue to single_crochet until you reach the ch1 space that represents the middle of the front of your sweater you will continue to do the increase pattern in this space to maintain the v throughout the pattern so place a single_crochet ch1 single_crochet grouping in the ch1 space repeat the same steps you took for the other side for this side ensuring that use the same number of fsc or chs under the armpit sl to the first single_crochet ch2 turn the rest of the body of the sweater follows the same alternating double_crochet and single_crochet row that you used in the yoke except the only place where you will use the *stitch ch1 stitch* grouping will be in the last remaining ch1 space at the front of the sweater when you reach the area under the arm crochet across normally without adding any new corners if you used a chain rather than fsc keep in mind that you will also be attaching stitches from the sleeve to this chain the next steps are where you can do the most customization of the size of your sweater if you have larger breasts or a larger stomach you may wish to continue increasing at the front without decreasing along the sides if you have small breasts or no breasts you will start decreasing right away when you are ready to start decreasing place your decreases near the middle of the area under your arm if you want to make a sweater that is smaller around the stomach than the chest add an additional decrease per row i would recommend placing each decrease near where the corners of your yoke had been and allow them to progressively get closer to each other with each round until you have enough space for only one more decrease if you end up with just 1 stitch between each decrease you can do a decrease with all 3 remaining stitches once the circumference of the body of your sweater is set to however tight you"
