    "content": "this pattern is for any gauge any yarn weight any size but small patch-sized flags require fingering weight or lighter heavier yarns will limit how small your flag can be this modular palestinian flag is best for intermediate knitters or adventurous beginners who are feeling up to it everything is shaped with increases and decreases and joined by picking up selvage stitches as you work sideways this way there s no intarsia or seaming **the zine version is exclusive to my free patreon 1 so go there if you want a little pattern booklet ** **for further visual help with elements of this project that may be unfamiliar there is a video of the project here 2 ** i knit a progress flag and a palestinian flag awhile back using an intarsia pattern and it worked but i don t love doing intarsia it made me get to thinking i bet i could figure out a modular way to create these designs using techniques i ve used in other patterns so i started thinking about the construction of my color by number 3 modular pattern set and how could i make that work and then the bias idea hit me use bias stripes and a chevron center stripe to create the edge of the triangle part so i tested it out it totally worked and i set out to turn it into a free pattern so anyone who wants to knit a palestinian flag can if you prefer patterns to be fundraisers then please give some funds to a gaza gofundme or an org that helps palestine as thanks for this pattern thank you 1 https //www patreon com/posts/freefree-pattern-133753952 2 https //youtu be/unjg2axgpy8 3 https //www ravelry com/patterns/sources/color-by-number"
