  "notes": "a pretty addition to an afghan or larger blanket, this square incorporates floral and geometric motifs with interesting stitch patterns, plenty of texture and the chance to play with colour. the written instructions are clearly laid out and each round has its own photographic illustration to keep you on the right track.\r\n\r\nthe tote bag shown was constructed using the jackfield tile tote bag pattern, available [here][1].\r\n\r\nsalthouse road is the address of the jackfield tile museum in shropshire in the english midlands - the beautiful, intricate and colourful ceramic tiles produced there in victorian times have always been a huge source of inspiration for my designs.\r\n\r\n**very honoured once again to be part of the marvellous block-a-month-crochet-along (bamcal) project as the featured square for february 2025. join in the fun with this friendly group [here][2].**\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/the-jackfield-tile-tote-bag\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/groups/2025-crochet-block-a-month-cal",
