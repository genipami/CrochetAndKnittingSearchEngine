  "notes": "the crochet baby shower blanket is a nice easy repeat once you get moving along with it. with a bit of texture, it has enough detail to keep you engaged with the project.\r\n\r\nthis blanket looks great in solid colours so you don’t need to mess around with colours but you can opt to change the colours in different rounds to make certain elements pop off the blanket.\r\n\r\nthe blanket is 38″ x 38″ square. the lovey size is 24″ x 24″. it has some easy popcorn stitches combined with faux popcorn and v-stitches to tempt your texture desires.\r\n\r\nlovey size: for parents on the go, sometimes a child cannot part with their blanket but an option is to make a lovey size. it’s a miniature sample. my brother as a young boy couldn’t part with his blanket without a lot of fuss and it was always a chore to drag it with us. the lovey can be made with the same yarn so it gives the illusion that it’s the same blanket.\r\n\r\nthis blanket is pretty fast to crochet and there is a specific note in the pattern to watch for. keep an eye on rnds 10 and 11."
