    "content": "what is a distaff it holds wool as you spin this cuff is intended to hold fiber away from the spindle so it doesn t get tangled while keeping a quantity at the ready so you don t need to keep attaching several small bits of fiber the pattern is written for one size the ribbing sucks in small enough to fit my 7-year-old s wrist but stretches enough to fit my wrist if you have a very large wrist stitches can be added to the non-provisionally cast on edge in multiples of four or a larger needle and yarn combination could be used this cuff uses very little yarn and is a great use for leftovers"
