  "notes": "faq:\r\nq: can i use cast-on method x instead? \r\na: as described in the pattern – use your preferred provisional cast-on method if you do not mind the half stitch offset. if you do mind, the pattern offers one method to make the stitches line up. another method would be to use any stretchy cast-on for the first half, then pick up one stitch through center of each cast-on stitch for the other half – this is tricky since you will pick up through decreased stitches, but possible.\r\n\r\nq: why does the given stitch count on each dpn not add up to the number of cast on stitches?\r\na: as described in the pattern – for the two way cast-on you work a decrease round (round 1) before the dpn stitch count is given.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe star can be knit in other gauge, the finished size will then be different. any yarnweight knit at a firm enough gauge, so that it can hold the stuffing, could be used.\r\n\r\nneedles us 2½ / 3 mm circular 24 inches / 60 cm\r\nus 2½ / 3 mm double pointed needles, **set of six**\r\ntapestry needle & stuffing\r\n\r\nthank you to http://www.ravelry.com/people/mgmills \r\nfor testknitting and much appreciated help with editing the pattern!"
