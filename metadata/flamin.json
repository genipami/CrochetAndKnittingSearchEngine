  "notes": "this hat incorporates fireflowers to add that extra bit of heat (barbara walker's a second treasury of knitting patterns). the fireflowers may look difficult but are worked with only one color each round; and they only require 30 yards/metres of contrast yarn, so it can be a great way to use that favorite colorful hand-dyed yarn. or use neon colors to make those flowers flaming hot! the hat works up warmly and quickly in a bulky weight yarn.\r\n\r\nsize\r\nadult s(l)\r\nnote: choose a size with 1-3 inches/2.5-7 cm negative ease in circumference\r\n\r\nfinished measurements\r\ncircumference:  18.5(20.5) inches/ 47(52) cm\r\nheight:  8.5(9.5) inches/ 22(24) cm - adjustable\r\n\r\nmaterials\r\nyarn blue (shown in size s above):\r\nmalabrigo yarn chunky [100% merino; 104 yd/95 m per 100g];\r\n[mc] color #150 azul profundo; 1 skein\r\n[cc] color #866 arco iris; approximately 30 y/27 m\r\nspacer pom pom: toft, color camel\r\n\r\nyarn burgundy (shown in size l below):\r\n[mc] cascade yarns 128 superwash [100% merino; 128 y/117 m per 100g]; color #855 burgundy; 1 skein\r\n[cc] malabrigo yarn mecha [100% merino; 130 yd/119 m per 100g]; color #850 archangel; approx 33 y/30 m\r\n\r\nyarn multi-color with glow-in-the-dark flowers (shown at the beginning of directions in size s ):\r\n[mc] spincycle yarns plump [100% merino; 100.0 yards /91.4 meters]; color afternoon delight; 1 skein\r\n [cc] lion brand diy glow [100% polyester; 71 y/65 m per 50g]; color off-white; 1 skein, using 2 strands twisted together – see pattern notes\r\npom pom: made with approx equal lengths of mc and cc, approx 25 g and 10 g\r\n\r\nyarn multi-color with neon flowers (shown at end of directions in size s):\r\n[mc] spincycle yarns plump [100% wool; 100 yd/91 m]; color vibe check 1 skein\r\n[cc] yarn snob a blissful bulky [100% merino; 106 yd/97 m per 100g]; color beneon; approx 30 y/27 m\r\nspacer pom pom: schildkraut fur large pom pom, color lime\r\n\r\n\r\nyarn characteristics\r\nmc yarns were bulky 100% wool in superwash yarns and lightly springy. smoother yarns work best for the cc so the fireflower petals can adjust to an attractive shape. it is possible to substitute two strands of worsted-weight yarns but you will need to twist/ply them together so they don't separate as you're working. i chose to do this so that i could take advantage of the fun glow-in-the-dark lion brand yarn. see pattern notes for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nrecommended needle size\r\n[always use a needle size that gives you the gauge listed below - every knitter's gauge is unique] \r\n us #10.5/6.5 mm 16 inch/40 cm circular needle\r\nus #10.5/6.5 mm needles for small circumference in the round, for the crown decreases\r\n us #9/5.5 mm 16 inch/40 cm circular needle\r\nnote: if using a tubular cast on, you will need an extra needle, see instructions for the particular cast-on method\r\n\r\nnotions\r\nstitch marker\r\noptional pom-pom\r\nyarn needle\r\n\r\ngauge\r\n14 sts/24 rounds = 4 inches/10 cm in stockinette stitch with mc yarn using the larger size needle\r\n16 sts/30 rounds = 4 inches/10 cm in fireflower pattern stitch using the larger size needle\r\n\r\npattern notes\r\n[knitty's list of standard abbreviations and techniques can be found here.]\r\n\r\nif you're working with worsted weight yarn for the cc, you need to twist/ply two strands together. you'll need about 11 yards/10 m of twisted yarn for each time you work the pattern rounds. if you're a spinner, use your preferred plying method. if you're not a spinner, follow this tutorial for creating a twisted cord, using a hand-mixer. a device like this can also make the process easier.\r\n\r\nchoose highly contrasting colors to make the flowers stand out. two solid colors, or one variegated and one solid color work best. two variegated colors may appear too \"busy\" and the flowers lose their visual definition.\r\n\r\nthe pattern uses only one color per round. the number of stitches on the needles increase greatly in rounds 2 & 3, and are decreased to the original number over the next few rounds. the added stitches are slipped and subsequently carried up over several rounds so they add minimally to the hat circumference.\r\n\r\nmaintain your usual tension on the working yarn when slipping multiple stitches in rounds 4-7. this will draw the slipped stitches somewhat together. do not float the yarn loosely as you would for stranded knitting, nor pull the yarn tightly.\r\n\r\nthere is a rapid decrease at the top for a slightly gathered look.\r\n\r\ndanish translation available [here][1] with many thanks to marianne holmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://strikkeglad.dk/46504/flammeblomster/"
