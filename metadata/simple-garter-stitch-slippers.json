  "notes": "a simple garter stitch slipper pattern knitted flat and seamed with neat crocheted finishing. the pattern is written for women's size large but the size is easily customized.\r\n\r\nthe pattern calls for two small skeins of fingering weight sock yarn. these yarns are held double (note the opportunity to use up your sock yarn scraps!) and thus can be replaced with a single strand of worsted weight yarn.\r\n\r\n***\r\nfor instructions on how to start with a seamless cast-on please see [this thread][1].\r\n\r\nfor instructions on the three-needle bind-off please see [this][2] and [this][3] thread.\r\n\r\nfor help with the crochet seam please see [this thread][4].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/discuss/patterns/2820342/1-25#14\r\n  [2]: http://www.ravelry.com/discuss/patterns/2825078/1-25\r\n  [3]: http://www.ravelry.com/discuss/patterns/2961665/1-25#1\r\n  [4]: http://www.ravelry.com/discuss/patterns/3282603/1-25",
