  "notes": "this beanie starts as a basic rectangle. we’ll seam the edges so that the first row matches up to the last row, and then cinch up the top. wear the beanie more slouchy, or pull it tighter and roll up the cuff. great for children or men, or throw a big ol’ faux fur pom pom on top to give it a more feminine vibe.\r\n\r\n**materials:**\r\n\r\nbernat super value (or any worsted weight yarn)\r\n65 yards for newborn\r\n80 yards for 3/6m\r\n90 yards for 6/12m\r\n100 yards for toddler\r\n140 yards for child\r\n160 yards for teen\r\n195 yards for adult\r\n\r\ncrochet hook in size h/5mm"
