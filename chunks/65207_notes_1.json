    "content": "a sweater pattern for those hard-to-fit greyhounds i added some photos of an aran version of this sweater i picked a few cable panels from a stitch dictionary then added some extra stitches to the belly panel and the sides of the torso to compensate for the pull-in factor of the cable work i haven t blocked/steamed it yet but i think it would relax a bit and stop pulling at the buttons **april 29 2009** i uploaded a new version of the pattern the only change was to remove the instructions for the leash slit as i have received a lot of feedback that it was in the wrong place on the neck **nov 23 2016** added norwegian translation of pattern text"
