    "content": "this is a really simple sweater i adapted from a vintage vogue knitting it is perfect for a first sweater because it does not use any advanced techniques and is knit in stockinette and ribbing gauge is not important as it has an oversized fit but measurements can be easily manipulated to fit tighter or looser"
