  "notes": "this little christmas bauble is knitted two-stranded in the round on dpns. the motif depicts two pine trees with the numbers 2025 central on the bauble, and it has a ribbon attached to the top for hanging. for these i’ve used fibre filling, but you may also knit around a plastic or glass bauble.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is both written and charted. it uses kfb, m1r, m1l  (but other increases may be used), and k2tog/ssk for decreases. the pattern is written for dpns, but if you’re more comfortable knitting on magic loop, that’s works too.\r\n\r\n**size:**\r\n\r\nheight: 6.5 cm/2.5”\r\ncircumference: 20 cm/8”\r\n\r\n**gauge:**\r\n\r\n32 sts per 10 cm/4”\r\n\r\n**materials:**\r\n\r\nyarn: light fingering (210 m per 50 gr) in two colours. approx. 5 grams of each colour.\r\ndpns size 2.5 mm (or circulars)\r\nfibre filling (or bauble approx. 6 cm diametre)\r\ndarning needle\r\n\r\nyarn suggestions: arwetta by filcolana, flora by drops, schachenmayr sockenwolle 4-ply"
