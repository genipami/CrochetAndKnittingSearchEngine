    "content": "simple to knit but very effective when knitted with malabrigo or similar yarn great for last minute knits or charity knitting i ve included a sizing table so you can knit with most weights many thanks to xstitch /people/xstitch for testing and for the lovely photos you could also make a cowl because it s a nice flat non-rolling stitch - just bind off in pattern on round 1 or 3"
