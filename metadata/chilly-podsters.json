  "notes": "texting-friendly and ipod-friendly mitts in fast and warm worsted weight? why yes!\r\n\r\nthis is a worsted-weight version of my [podster mitts][1] pattern, a convertible mitten-glove pattern with a modified thumb for you to keep your thumbs flying over the texting keyboard or mp3 player – for even colder winter temperatures. \r\n\r\nworked cuff-up in the round. these are worked on worsted (or dk) at a snug gauge of 6 sts/inch, to help keep the chill away! substitute your favourite stashed worsted or dk and get going on your own pair for the cold season ahead.\r\n\r\nwhile this is offered as a free pattern it is not necessarily a 'beginner' pattern. it is strongly recommended that the knitter have some familiarity with mitten or glove construction, or be comfortable forging ahead into this territory if it is new.\r\n\r\n*please note i am not able to guarantee pattern support for free patterns after their 1st year of release. \r\nthis pattern was originally released in 2011.*\r\n\r\n\r\nmaterials \r\n•\tberroco ultra alpaca [50% alpaca/50% wool, 215 yds/198 m per 3.5 oz/100g skein], 1(2) skeins\r\nor 200(230) yds worsted-weight wool in a wool or wool/alpaca blend, if substituting yarns\r\n•\t3.25mm needles (dpns or long circular for magic loop) or needle size required for gauge\r\n•\ttapestry needle\r\n•\tstitch holder or waste yarn\r\n•\tstitch markers\r\n\r\nsizing\r\n•\ts(l)\r\n•\tto fit hand circumference 6.25-7.0 ins (7.25-8 ins) around; roughly equivalent to women’s small(women’s large/men’s small). \r\n\r\ngauge\r\n•\t24 sts/32 rows over 4 ins on 3.5mm needles or needle size required to obtain gauge \r\n(this will likely be 3-4 needle sizes smaller than the needle size you would normally use for worsted weight yarn)\r\n\r\nskills\r\nto execute this pattern, knitters will be required to: \r\n•\twork in the round\r\n•\twork knit and purl sts\r\n•\twork increases (m1) and decreases (ssk, k2tog, p2tog)\r\n•\tpick up sts (for working fingers and thumb)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/podster-gloves",
