    "content": "this pattern is free on my blog or you can purchase the pdf here the venti hood is big warm easy-care and sized just for kids the trenta hood is a favorite for adults and inspired requests for kid s sizes so i ve reworked this pattern in three sizes - ages 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years and 5 to 10 years having had little ones i don t think this style of hat would stay on a baby so i started with the toddler sizes and because of the oversize fit each size fits for a long time in addition to changing the sizes and proportions for kids i ve also used red heart soft - so it s easy to care for and you can make it in all their favorite colors i ve also linked to the pom poms i ve used - they are optional but they do also remove for washing and are just a lot of fun right and left-handed video tutorials included"
