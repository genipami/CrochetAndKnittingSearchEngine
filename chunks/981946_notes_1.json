    "content": "this pattern uses two stitch cables alternating with pools of ribbing to generate the pattern you ll need 150-200y of worsted weight yarn to complete this pattern i m a pretty loose knitter so keep an eye on your gauge before embarking on this pattern overall it is a pretty quick knit and is a great pattern to learn how to do cabling without a cabling needle there are tons of tutorials on youtube to learn how to do this - it really makes cabling much faster and easier"
