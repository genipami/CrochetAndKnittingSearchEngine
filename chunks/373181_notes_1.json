    "content": "this hat is designed to be a thick cozy winter hat with a simple stitch pattern for those who desire a hat that is more functional than fancy the size of the hat can be adjusted by adding or skipping the increasing rounds in the beginning it s a very versatile pattern and could be adjusted to fit a wide variety of head sizes as such i did not include gauge measurements i needed only one skein 170 yards of yarn but it essentially used the whole skein there would not have been enough yarn left to make a pouf for the top of the hat had i wanted to but if you were making a child s size hat it could be very cute with a pouf let me know if you have any questions"
