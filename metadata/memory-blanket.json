  "notes": "*i've had many many requests to add this how-to to the ravelry database.*\r\n\r\n*this is not an original idea, nor do i claim it to be. there are a trillion patterns for mitred square blanket, therefore i am not claiming this as an original pattern, but rather a how-to.* \r\n\r\n*this is, however, my approach to knitting a mitred square blanket, seamlessly and modular. for those who detest seaming a thousand little squares together, i hope this approach to mitred squares will be of use and open up the world of blanket making.*\r\n\r\n*i’ve knit my blanket with all the left-overs from mostly kids knits. for me, it provides a memory blanket of all the things i’ve knit for my kids; a visual capture of where they’ve been at that time in their lives, the places we’ve explored, the emotions we’ve felt and the experiences we’ve shared. a record of our journey through life together captured in yarn. it’s bold and bright, which is just the way i like my colours and kids!*\r\n\r\n**construction:**\r\nthis blanket is constructed seamless and modularly, knitting each square onto those already complete.\r\n\r\n**sizing:**\r\neach square measure approximately 3½ x 3½ inches/ 9 x 9 cms. you can make your blanket any size you like. be aware that as the blanket grows bigger the additional weight will stretch the blanket and the squares will be bigger. \r\n\r\ni've knit my squares in dk weight yarn but this how-to is easy to adapt to other yarn weights, for example, if you wanted to yield a similar size square but knit in sock weight yarn, cast on 26 stitches and aim for a tension of around 28 stitches over 4\". worsted weight at 20 stitches, cast on 18. \r\n\r\n**skill level:**\r\neasy\r\n\r\n**techniques used:**\r\ncasting on\r\nknit \r\nbasic decreasing\r\npicking up stitches\r\n\r\n\r\na german version of this pattern is available exclusively from [loveknitting][1]. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\njoin the [tikki ravelry group][2] for any pattern support, yarn advice or just for the chatter and knit-a-longs. an on-going memory blanket kal is hosted there. \r\n\r\n  [2]: http://www.ravelry.com/groups/tikki-love\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.loveknitting.com/memory-blanket-knitting-pattern-by-georgie-nicolson-tikki",
