  "notes": "**the story**\r\ni’ve had multiple requests for a detailed pattern to knit [my favorite vanilla socks][1] pattern with counter color cuffs, heels and toes. so without further ado - here she is: my favorite vanilla socks with a little extra oomph - extranilla!\r\n\r\n**materials**\r\n* main color: 300-400 yds fingering weight yarn\r\n* counter color: 125 yds fingering weight yarn\r\n* us 1½ (2.50mm) 32-inch circular needle (or preferred length; adjust needle size as necessary to match gauge)\r\n* removable stitch marker (1)\r\n* stitch markers (2)\r\n\r\n**notes**\r\n* these socks are worked from the cuff down, feature a modified eye of partridge gusset heel and use the kitchener stitch to close the toe. jogless stripe techniques are employed at the color changes to minimize the stair step effect often seen when changing colors at the end of a round.\r\n* this pattern includes written instructions only. make 2 socks to complete a pair.\r\n* instructions are given for smallest size with additional sizes in parentheses. when only one set of instructions is given, it applies to all sizes.\r\n* slip all sts purlwise unless otherwise noted.\r\n* this pattern is written for the magic loop technique however any method of circular knitting may be substituted. in case of using dpns, assume that the front needle is synonymous with needles 1 & 2, and that the back needle is synonymous with needles 3 & 4.\r\n\r\n***note:*** *required yardage will vary based on the size of sock being knit. the yardage above assumes the largest sock circumference and a very long foot. the sample socks, knit in the medium size for a women’s size 6½ shoe, used only 80 yds of cc and 220 yds of mc. plan accordingly!*\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/my-favorite-vanilla-socks",
