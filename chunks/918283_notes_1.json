    "content": "the no waste hat is a basic block colored hat knitted bottom up there is really no such thing as waste yarn having a stash of yarn is of course always a treasure but still those odd little yarn balls have a tendency to multiply and the inspiration to cast on a big ambitious waste yarn project is not always there this is a quick way of creating space for new yarn and at the same time make something useful with that leftover yarn that you have laying around without having to plan or count or be nervous about having enough of each color and the best of all -no yarn is wasted so line up your odd little yarn balls and start knitting"
