    "content": "stiffen this lacy crocheted snowflake with fabric stiffener or a mixture of glue and water for an ornament or stitch many together to create a lacy winter scarf shawl or even tablecloth the sample version was made with size 10 crochet cotton in white and a #3 steel hook but the original prototype was done with light worsted weight yarn and an h hook you can try different yarn weights and hook sizes for different effects but i do recommend cotton thread and a small steel hook if you want to use this snowflake as a tree ornament"
