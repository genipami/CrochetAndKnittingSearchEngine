  "notes": "there's some bunny in the hood! i hope you like living in your hoodies as much as i do. adding to my amigurumi bunny family, meet this new little cutie who is the newest free pattern on the blog.\r\n\r\ngrowing up, hoodies are my daily uniform. heck, what am i talking about? hoodies are still a part of my daily wardrobe! this adorable bunny wearing a hoodie is one of my most popular crochet patterns ever designed. fun fact: did you know that in saskatchewan, canada, hoodies are referred to as bunny hugs? i've made this amigurumi bunny using worsted-weight yarn as well as chunky yarn for a cuddle-size amigurumi! this pattern is suitable for beginners who are learning to crochet but make sure you know how to crochet a sphere. sewing is required to piece it together.\r\n"
