  "notes": "in this step-by-step video tutorial you will learn how to crochet this classic fisherman style hat using the short row technique.  don't worry if you have never made a hat using short rows it is really easy and i will walk you through all of the steps.\r\n\r\ncrocheting short rows is my favorite technique for making hats.  this hat is worked in rows using the most basic crochet stitch - the single crochet worked in the back loop only (blo).  if you can do a single crochet stitch then you can make this hat!.  \r\n\r\ni love using short rows to create hats because there is not gathering at the top so you end up with a perfectly fitted hat.\r\n\r\ni have made this hat for myself in every colour.  this is the perfect everyday hat.   this is also the perfect unisex hat to make as gifts for everyone on your list.  this is a crochet hat that everyone will love.    \r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy making this crochet hat as much as i enjoyed making this video for you.  thank you to everyone who has watched my videos and subscribed to my channel.\r\n\r\nif you are looking for more free crochet patterns check out my youtube channel - woodcamper crochet crafts.\r\n\r\nhappy crocheting\r\n"
