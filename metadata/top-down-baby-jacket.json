  "notes": "this pattern is very simple if you follow it step by step and don't deviate even when it doesn't seem to be working.\r\n\r\ni can make this in less than a day making it a great last minute gift.\r\nit takes less than 100g of dk yarn (i usually use acrylic) but equivalent can be used.\r\ni have also used ww and a 5mm hook to make it for 3+ months.\r\n\r\nfeel free to tell me if you find any mistakes.\r\n\r\ni used this free pattern for the beanies\r\n[beanie pattern][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/basic-half-double-crochet-hat-2\r\n\r\ni am seeing lots making the same 2 errors: first every increase is 3 stitches in the same stitch not the usual 2\r\n\r\nyou must count the front stitches and trust i have counted them and know how many there should be, those that think they know better get a wonky front edge that is too long. those that follow the pattern have a great result.\r\n",
