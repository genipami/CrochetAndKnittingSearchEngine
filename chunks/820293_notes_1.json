    "content": "you will need approximately 210 hexagons i suggest making at least 250 hexagons so that you will have alternate color choices to choose from my afghan is 14 hexies long by 15 hexies wide it measures 53 x 58 i find this to be a good size for using as a blanket on a couch it is big enough to take a nap under of course you can make yours larger by adding more hexagons the finished afghan is 1260 grams you will need approximately 1400 grams for the afghan because you lose bits in seaming and weaving in ends i used a selection of colors that were included in my two different yarn lines over the years sadly both the lines are discontinued but you may be able to find them on-line here is a video 1 i made talking about color placement and seaming together with whip stitch 1 https //www youtube com/watch v=lsijny8vana&t=47s"
