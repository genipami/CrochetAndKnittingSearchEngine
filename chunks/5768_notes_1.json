    "content": "this pattern is available free on my blog with a detailed picture tutorial as it seems rather strange the first time through after the first few row this becomes a quick and easy pattern to complete i used a cotton made in holland and i estimate that it is about a size 3 cotton it is thinner than sugar n cream or peaches n cream but any size cotton can be used with the correct size hook i tried my hand with the larger cotton anchor magicline and used a f hook 3 75mm which turned out nicely please note that the larger yarns will need a smaller hook than requested for that yarn or a tighter gauge as having a loose gauge will result in larger holes between the clusters"
