  "notes": "this is a vintage styled head band with ties around the head. this pattern is perfect for knitters who have learned the basic knit and purl, and want to advance in learning simple increase and decrease. \r\n\r\nparts include the ties, ribbing and main head piece are all adjustable.\r\n\r\nafterthought: the length i knitted originally put the ribbing parts under my hair (if i tie the head band under my hair) so you can’t see them. if you want the ribbing nearer your ears, knit the head piece shorter (shorter than 34cm).\r\n\r\nalso, if you’re not a beginner you can consider to duplicate stitch a ribbon (or anything) on your head band.\r\n\r\nplease tag me @madebym.ka on instagram as i would love to see your finished work!\r\n\r\nfor a full tutorial, please subscribe to my youtube channel and support me :wink: \r\n\r\n**2-1-2025**\r\nplease download updated pdf for the correction on row 5.",
