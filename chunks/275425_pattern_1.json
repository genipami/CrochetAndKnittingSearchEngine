    "content": "nata s knitivity donkey by renata brenner i wanted to knit a donkey for this nativity and couldn t find a pattern i was happy with so i decided i d try using what i had learned about shaping while knitting the figures in jean greenhowe s christmas crib i am absolutely delighted with how she turned out and thought i d share the pattern unlike the figures in the christmas crib this pattern is worked in the round and except for the ears is completely seamless this makes knitting and stuffing a bit more complicated but i think the result is worth the extra effort i have used paired lifted increases and paired decreases for symmetry and to make them less obvious links to tutorials are provided size height 4 to shoulder 5 to top of ears length 6 5 nose to tail gauge 26 st over 4 /10cm in stockinet yarn about 1oz of gray dk or worsted weight yarn a few yards each of white and black yarn if you use dk weight yarn use us size 2 or the same size needles you used for the other figures i knit tightly using worsted weight yarn and size 2 needles and my christmas crib figures are the specified size if you use worsted weight yarn and you don t want to knit tightly use smaller needles notions double pointed needles dpn sizes us 1 & 2 small crochet hook tapestry needle 4 safety pins or locking stitch markers to hold stitches stitch holders are too big and will get in the way polyester filling and a chopstick or pencil to push stuffing in notes i am assuming that you have knitted in the round on dpns before and can move stitches from one needle to the other if two stitches of a decrease are on adjacent needles or the distribution of stitches becomes awkward the donkey is worked in the round from nose to tail with no seams live stitches for the legs are held on safety pins stitches for legs are picked up and the legs are also worked in the round stuffing needs to be added as the donkey progresses i stuffed very aggressively especially before drawing up and tying off the body and the legs are stuffed very firmly to give the rigidity adding stuffing in lots of small pieces increases firmness i have suggested points during the knitting when you might add stuffing but you are not limited to those points all ends except the tail are hidden by using a tapestry needle to pass the end through the body to come out between stitches passed over one bar between stitches and back through the body a few times when the end is snipped off close to the body it will disappear into the body i recommend using jean greenhowes s join for all yarn joins abbreviations st stitch k knit p purl k2tog knit 2 stitches together right leaning decrease ssk slip"
