    "content": "this granny ripple afghan pattern is the second pattern i ve written i hope you enjoy the afghan blanket is very adaptable to any kind of yarn and can be easily scaled to what ever size you want i used red heart super saver yarn because its inexpensive colorful and very durable i ve made a couple of these blankets for charity now also it s a great project o use up little bits of yarn left over from other projects and would adapt beautifully to a baby blanky if you used baby-weight yarn i know there are thousands of other ripple aka chevron afghans out there but i like this one because the v is more pronounced and dramatic i looked all over to find a pattern for it and didn t find it so i just made the pattern to share with you \u263a"
