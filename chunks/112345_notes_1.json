    "content": "thank you marianne topping 1 for the danish translation a very basic top down raglan with almost no seaming required includes sizing / shaping for both men and women and despite its name a crew-neck variation as well it is designed to be a casual loose fit but could easily be made more fitted by increasing the waist shaping row and choosing a size that fits more closely the neck trim can also be left off for a more open v-neck **suitable for a knitter with some experience** please review the pattern before you start it s free while the *sweater* is simple you may not find the *instructions* simple as they are quite basic so if you have never made a top down raglan before you may need to find a tutorial first to help visualize the raglan increases there are **3 actions taking place at the same time** 1 the raglan incs for the front & back 2 the raglan incs for the sleeves 3 the incs for the v-neck they do not all happen at the same rate therefore they are given as separate instructions you can follow the instructions as given which requires you look at your work and depending which section you are in and when you made the last increase determine if it s time to work another increase or not if you prefer to think of it as row by row you will need to transpose the instructions in that format any other questions should be posted here 2 a separate sheet with the finished measurements **in inches** is provided compliments of yvonne 3 1 http //www ravelry com/people/tullemomsemor 2 https //www ravelry com/discuss/heidi-kirrmaier/2341784/201-225#205 3 http //www ravelry com/people/yvonnegut"
