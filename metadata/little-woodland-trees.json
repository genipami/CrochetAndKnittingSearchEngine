  "notes": "crochet christmas tree motifs that can be used for hanging decorations or gift wrapping. or, string together to make a garland. \r\n\r\nuse any yarn with smaller hook size than is recommended on the ball band.\r\n\r\ni used 4ply cotton with 3mm hook (us d/3).\r\ni also used double knitting yarn (light worsted weight) with 4mm hook (us g/6).\r\n\r\nsimple crochet stitches are used - single crochet (us) or double crochet (uk). stitches are worked into the back loops only, to create the ridged effect.\r\n\r\ncrochet trees begin at the bottom edge, and are worked towards the tip of the tree. the trunk is added on to the base of the tree.\r\n\r\ni have written the instructions in both us and uk crochet terms so you can choose your preference. \r\n\r\nthis is a pattern from my archive library that was once published in a part-weekly magazine many years ago and is now free on my blog as part of the stash to sparkle blog hop 2025."
