  "notes": "how to crochet a ribbon lace scarf! this stunning scarf looks complicated but is in fact, a very simple and easy 3 row repeat! \r\n\r\nmade entirely in one piece, it shows off your variegated yarns beautifully. if you are looking for something a little bit different to crochet that has the “wow” factor, then this is the scarf for you!\r\n\r\n yarn & hook information: suitable for any yarn - use the recommended hook size for your chosen yarn \r\n\r\nfor my scarf i used 1 x ball of sirdar jewelspun with wool in the colourway “precious reef” with a 6mm hook \r\n\r\nmy scarf is approximately 10ft long with 47 motifs in total (including first and last motif)"
