    "content": "a simple coaster for knitting beginners with a little christmas tree on it the pattern only requires you to know to knit and purl the design is really really simple and i created it to teach a friend the differences between knits and purls - while still finishing something that might be used as a decoration for the upcoming holidays you will only need scraps of sturdy cotton yarn i provided a gauge but i don t think it s entirely useful as a swatch would actually be bigger than this little coaster while not entirely needed i also attached a picture how you could possibly embellish the finished coaster with some simple french knots"
