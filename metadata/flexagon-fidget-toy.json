  "notes": "> **free video pattern** the pattern is available as [right-handed][1] and\r\n> [left-handed][2] videos that are\r\n> public/free to watch.\r\n\r\n**about the pattern**\r\n\r\nif you know anyone who can’t stand still no matter how many times they are told to stop moving, who jump around, click pens, shake their legs, tap or touch things incessantly, that’s exactly who this toy is for. \r\n\r\nthis toy is inspired by the origami hexaflexagon, a three-dimensional piece that is turned in one of both directions, revealing four different faces made up of three diamonds.\r\n\r\nthe best thing is that you can just throw it in the washing machine when it starts looking less than pristine.\r\n\r\nsince it’s such a simple project, you can make many of these and gift them to local organizations, not just people in your family or circle of friends. they will surely be appreciated.\r\n\r\n**technical notes**\r\n\r\nthe pattern is suitable for beginner crocheters with a few projects under their belt. i would not recommend this as your first crochet project, but it can be done. \r\n\r\nthe pattern includes us and uk terms and comes with full instructions and photos. you shouldn’t have any issues making one of these toys in no time if you’ve made amigurumi before.\r\n\r\nif you want to print the pattern, you only need to print two pages, which are super printer friendly, since they only consist of text, as you can see from the pattern preview.\r\n\r\n**low vision versions**\r\nthe pattern now comes with easy read and mobile friendly versions, following these principles:\r\n\r\nthe main text is written in 24 point arial font.\r\n\r\n28 point and bold is used for headings.\r\n\r\nphoto captions use 22 point font.\r\n\r\nblack font for all text and white background.\r\n\r\nleft justified text, 1 inch margins, no columns.\r\n\r\npage numbers are on the bottom left part of the page.\r\n\r\nno charts required to use the pattern.\r\n\r\nall abbreviations are explained in the list.\r\n\r\nlarge photos, at most one per page, with accompanying alt text and caption.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://youtu.be/zweh9grsph4\r\n  [2]: https://youtu.be/8qhmjorvq2c"
