  "notes": "this easy-to-knit baby cardigan is knit from the bottom up in one piece.  \r\n\r\ntwo options are available for knitting the sleeves:  \r\n\r\n* knit flat from the cuff up and seamed, or;\r\n* pick-up stitches from the armhole and knit down in the round.\r\n\r\nthe button bands and neck are added after the sweater is complete by picking up stitches and working the ribbing.\r\n\r\nbonus:  pattern includes instructions for making a simple hat as well.\r\n\r\nuse any worsted yarn to whip-up this cardigan for the babies in your life.\r\n\r\nadditional notes\r\nre: **“place 6 sts. on holder at front edge, etc”**\r\nlet me describe this as if you are working on the right front:\r\n\r\nknit across 6 stitches (this is at the center front) and put those on holder.\r\ncontinue knitting to finish row(ending at armhole edge)\r\npurl back\r\nbind off 2 stitches, knit across\r\npurl back\r\nbind off 1 stitch, knit across\r\npurl back\r\nbind off 1 stitch, knit across\r\npurl back\r\ncontinue per instructions…. \r\nonce you’re done with the right front, the left front will be the same, except you will knit across and then on the purl row you’ll put the 6 stitches on a holder, and the decreases will be done at the beginning of the purl rows instead of the knit rows!\r\n\r\nre: **joining shoulders for top-down sleeves on dpns**: first you do a 3-needle bind off for the shoulders, then you can pick up the stitches for the sleeves, using dpns and.starting at the bottom(armhole) of sleeve.",
