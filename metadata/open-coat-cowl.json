  "notes": "a while back sam sifton wrote a nytimes cooking newsletter that featured something i really loved: no-recipe recipes. they were a framework for making something with room to improvise, depending on your own creativity, pantry, and common sense. we could use more of that in the knitting world, so this is my attempt at a knitting no-recipe recipe.\r\n\r\nthe open coat cowl is a neck warmer that does what it says: keeps you warm with your coat open, with a snug fit at the neck and a bandana style front to tuck in your jacket. stockinette stitch, no fuss, and cozy snefnug by camarose does all the heavy lifting: a very simple pattern you can easily modify to suit you.\r\n\r\np.s. sam’s hasselback kielbasa is my favorite of the no-recipe recipes. we make it at our house at least once a month during the winter.\r\n\r\n**what you’ll need**\r\nsnefnug by camarose, (120 yards per 50 gram skein): 175 yards total. the more cowls you knit, the more bits and bobs you’ll have left over to add stripes to future cowls. change colors as often as you’d like. or don’t. it’s your cowl.\r\n\r\nus 9 (5.5 mm) 16” circular needle\r\n\r\nstitch marker, darning needle\r\n\r\nfinished dimensions: 20” long at longest point x 19” circumference. want it bigger or smaller? increase more or less before joining in the round\r\n\r\ngauge: 17 sts = 4\" in stockinette stitch. gauge isn’t crucial, but you don’t want a loose, open fabric in the dead of winter. \r\n",
