  "notes": "how about exploring your creativity with this tunisian crochet kerchief? with just two basic tunisian crochet stitches you can make this little shawl and become skillful in a new craft. after a few repeats you'll get the hang of this pattern, so expect easy crocheting ahead. if you want to learn the tunisian crochet skills first, stick with the one-color option. if you're an adventurous maker, go with the two-colored striped version.\r\n\r\n**creatief kerchief** (pronouncement: *kree-a-tief*) is dutch for \"to create\" and \"creatively\". this design is an invitation to create your own, maybe first, tunisian crochet item made to your liking. the creative process starts with choosing your yarn colors, maybe by browsing your stash. when you finish the creatief kerchief the creativity continues because it can be tied and styled in different ways.\r\n\r\nthis neckerchief is diamond shaped and can be worn in several ways around the neck which makes it a versatile accessory. when wrapped around your neck there are several ways to tie or bind it – a kerchief-/scarf ring works well, or just tie it as you like. but the creative options are unlimited, consider for instance wearing it as a headwrap, belt or bracelet. \r\n\r\n**size:** \r\nadjustable to accommodate your yardage and gauge\r\n\r\n**finished measurements:** \r\nsamples shown measures:\r\nwidth: 7.75 inches/20 cm\r\nlength: 47.25 inches/120 cm\r\n\r\n**yarn:**\r\nsample 1, two colors striped version:\r\nholst supersoft [50% merino wool and 50% shetland wool; 314yd/287m per 50g skein]; [mc] indigo (033); 1 skein, [cc] ecru (098); 1 skein. the sample used roughly half of the mc skein (approximately 140 yds/130 m) and about a third of the cc skein (approximately 80 yds/70 m)\r\nsample 2, single-color version:\r\nannell super extra color [75% superwash wool and 25% polyamide; 460yd/420m per 100g skein]; 2912 (blue variegated); 1 skein. roughly half the skein was used for the sample (approximately 210 yds/190 m)\r\nnote: tunisian crochet creates a dense fabric so when substituting yarn use a light-fingering weight for a similar lightweight kerchief; for example a sock set, a few minis or a self-striping yarn. \r\n\r\n**hook:**\r\nus h/8/5 mm tunisian crochet hook with a stopper or cable. always use a needle size that gives you the gauge listed below - every knitter's gauge is unique. \r\nnote: if you don't have a tunisian crochet hook, this can be substituted with a standard crochet hook without an ergonomic handle and a rubber band secured over and over until it makes a little knob at the end. at the widest point in this pattern, the stitches might be a little bunched up on the hook after a forward pass.\r\n\r\n**gauge:**\r\n17 stitches/15 rows = 4 inches/10 cm in pattern repeat (2 rows tss, 1 row tfs)"
