    "content": "this hat uses mosaic knitting techniques to create the grid like pattern if you haven t used mosaic knitting before it is the easiest way to add colorwork into a pattern - you never have to carry two colors at once in this pattern you will only ever knit the primary color black in the photos while the other colors are a combination of knit/purl/slip stitches it is a relatively quick knit and the pattern is quite simple - perfect for tv based knitting this pattern will fit an average adult head 22 5 but can easily be adjusted larger or smaller because the pattern repeats every 2 stitches you ll want about 150y of the main color and 25y of each of the four other colors also my knitting is usually looser than most people - make sure you test your gauge before starting i knit this hat using us5s but my test knitters used between us7-9 to match my size"
