  "notes": "the finished blanket measures 120cm x 120cm (4 square feet). \r\n\r\nthere are 73 squares in total; 9 large and 64 small. \r\n\r\nonce all 73 squares have been made and joined, a wide border is worked to complete the blanket.\r\n\r\nit's a good idea to be familiar with your own personal tension and experiment with moving to a larger or smaller hook to achieve a neat result."
