  "notes": "the notorious cowl is a hooded cowl. it is knit from the bottom up in one piece. \r\n\r\nmy suggestion is to use a wool yarn of sport weight held double together with a lace weight yarn or a wool yarn of worsted weight held together with a lace weight yarn. \r\ni have used sport weight wool yarn held double together with mohair.\r\n\r\nyarn amount (approximately):\r\n120g (300m/100g) (sport weight) \r\ntogether with \r\n25g (210m/25g) (lace weight) \r\nor\r\n150g (130m/100g) (worsted weight)\r\ntogether with\r\n25g (210m/25g) (lace weight) \r\n\r\ngauge and needles:\r\n15 sts x 19 rows = 10x10 cm in stockinette stitch.\r\n6 mm circular needles 60 cm (or preferred length)\r\n\r\nyou will also need:\r\none extra 6 mm needle, whatever kind you have (a slightly smaller/larger size will also work).\r\ncrocket hook\r\ntapestry needle\r\nstitch markers\r\n\r\ntechniques:\r\ngerman short rows\r\nthree needle bind off\r\ntwisted rib (optional) \r\ntubular cast on (optional) – suggested alternative: long tail cast on.\r\nitalian bind off (optional) – suggested alternative: regular bind off.",
