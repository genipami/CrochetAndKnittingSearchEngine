    "content": "this lazy waves blanket is simple without being monotonous and it works up fairly quickly it is an excellent stash buster too i have used 2 strands of double knit yarn together but you can just as easily use 1 strand of worsted weight instead provided you match your gauge to the specified gauge your blanket will be the same size please note the yardage supplied is for using 1 strand of worsted weight yarn if you are going to use 2 strands of double knit yarn instead you will need about 5300 meters i have supplied a tutorial for making the lazy waves should you have any problems with figuring the pattern repeat out other than that have great fun dedri"
