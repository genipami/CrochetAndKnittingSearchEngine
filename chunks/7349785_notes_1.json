    "content": "the rose cotton headband is knitted flat with a delicate romantic lace pattern as the centerpiece and two i-cords bands at each end for easy fastening around the head it is a great stash buster as it uses relatively little yarn less than half of the skein the pattern comes in one size - but depending on how many row the lace repeat and i-cord bands are knitted it can be adjusted to be either longer or shorter the pattern is free and includes both a charted instruction for the lace repeats as well as written instructions - so that you can choose what fits you the best i hope you will enjoy this little project"
