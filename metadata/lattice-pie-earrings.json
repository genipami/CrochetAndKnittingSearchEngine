  "notes": "when i think of pies, the image that comes to mind is a fruit pie with a lovely lattice on top.  so while i was already working on making some miniature pies, i had to try to figure out how to make these iconic type of pies too.  here's what i came up with~!\r\n\r\nof course, you don't have to limit yourself to just making earrings or any other jewelry; these little pies also look great as refrigerator magnets, or as an accessory for barbie or other fashion dolls.\r\n\r\n**yarn:** any size 10 crochet thread, or four (4) strands of embroidery floss\r\n\r\nthe specific colors i used are:\r\n\r\nred heart classic crochet thread in victory red (cherry) (my assumption is that aunt lydia's victory red is the same color, but red heart is what i have & also what's available at walmart so...)\r\n\r\naunt lydia's in dark royal (blueberry) and copper mist (tan/crust)\r\n\r\n**finished size:** 1 1/8” in diameter (without jewelry findings)\r\n\r\n**skill level:** intermediate\r\n\r\n(for the record, this pattern does not explain how to attach any findings to your piece, it’s only a pattern for the pie itself.)\r\n\r\nit’s not a picture tutorial, but there are pictures explaining things!"
