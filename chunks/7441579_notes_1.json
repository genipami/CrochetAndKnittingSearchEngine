    "content": "this sock pattern draws inspiration from traditional gansey knitting a craft deeply rooted in the maritime communities of the british isles known for their resilience and richly textured motifs ganseys were essential garments for fishermen facing the brutal weather of the north sea and english channel made from tightly spun wool with minimal seams these sweaters featured patterns like cables chevrons and diamonds each symbolizing elements of seafaring life or family heritage traditional gansey patterns reflected a sense of place and identity this sock design tries to honor those motifs while scaling down and adapting them for a humble sock the pattern also pays quiet tribute to the herring quines the women who followed the herring fleets along the coast gutting fish and preparing them for export though their work was grueling moments of rest likely held the warmth of shared stories laughter and perhaps a bit of knitting this design is a nod to that spirit of strength community and craft size small medium large finished measurements to fit approx foot circumference of 7 8 9 /17 5 20 22 5 cm yarn 1 skein fingering weight sock yarn 437yds per 100g skein needles 2 25mm us 1 circular needles or dpns note i used 9 circular needles but you can use which ever method you prefer notions if desired cable needle 2 stitch markers attributes knit top down ribbed cuff heel flap & gusset questions if you run into any problems or have any questions please message me on ravelry or email knittingneedlesoup@protonmail com"
