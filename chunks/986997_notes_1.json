    "content": "i ve noticed a lot of knitters are nervous about choosing colors themselves this pattern was designed to allow knitters complete freedom each time you knit a repeat you can choose a different selection of colors be bold be experimental have fun and don t rip it back if you think it s not working if you have a palette of colors that look nice all together then your finished cowl will look lovely even if some of the individual combinations don t quite hit the mark this makes it ideal as a swatching project or just as a tool to explore color combinations the miniballs are perfect for this a shetland-type yarn spun in scotland that is perfect for colorwork and available in loads of colors however you can also use scraps of fingering weight yarn as you don t need much of each color this cowl is knitted in the round as a tube and the ends seamed or grafted the same motif is repeated throughout with different color combinations this sample uses 15 miniballs in different colours you can use a larger or smaller palette - whatever you prefer"
