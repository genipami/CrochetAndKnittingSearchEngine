  "notes": "here's another way to use those fiddly bits of sock/fingering yarn you've collected over the years to create something beautiful for your home. this pattern utilizes scraps sized from a few inches, up to multiple yards.  an added bonus is the simple garter stitch construction (perfect for tv binge-watching). and there are no ends to work in when you're finished, thanks to the magic of fringe.\r\n\r\nthe blanket/throw is knit diagonally up to the middle point and then flipped over to gradually decrease down to the final stitch. the finished product has an interesting, excavated earth appearance (hence the name) and decorative 4\" self-fringe on two opposite sides.\r\n\r\nyou can knit it any size you like.  the pattern model is 50\" x 50\" - big enough to wrap up in.  the model is done in a rainbow of colors, but you can choose any color combination for yours.  \r\n\r\nthanks to charlotte fillon for the new french translation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.etsy.com/shop/hipknitizer?ref=search_shop_redirect"
