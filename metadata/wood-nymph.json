  "notes": "wood nymphs are magical beings that live in the forests and woodlands. this sock pattern incorporates a lovely leaf lace stitch inspired by such creatures. \r\n\r\nthe leaf lace stitch is knit either the side of the socks. the stitch is charted and the socks are knit on circulars. this can be changed to dpns if you wish. the size is adjustable as well since the lace is not an all over pattern, however the pattern only includes size medium, for a size 7-8 foot. \r\n\r\nthis pattern has not been tech edited or test knit, please get in touch with me if there are any issues. happy knitting!\r\n",
