    "content": "this blanket was inspired by the widely known sock memory blanket and uses leftover sock yarns it is made from squares which are joined as they are knitted no seaming necessary the fun twist is that two fingering yarns are used together a commercial sock yarn and a hand dyed sock yarn are held together so you get the best of both worlds the result is stunning - the colors sing their own song as they are play together you can never guess what happens as you knit with them at the same time the fabric is thick yet soft and your blanket will be warm and cozy you are the boss of your blanket so you make the decision about the amount of squares and thus the size of it"
