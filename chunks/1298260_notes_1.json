    "content": "this pattern is a crochet kirby hat where he is attempting to eat your head the hat is designed to fit snugly on a 23 head to adjust the size i d recommend using a different size hook or removing a round or two of increases if making a child size the pattern requires at least 3 colors of yarn you might also want to use a slightly different red for the feet versus the inside of the mouth but if you only have one red it should be fine you need most of a skein of the pink and red yarns and just a bit of the darker pink for the tongue and the lighter red for the shoes the hat is worked in the round with the magic loop but you can start it another way if you prefer"
