  "notes": "the corner start afghan tutorial. also known as c2c,  corner to corner, corner box and diagonal box stitch. \r\n\r\nnow the original tutorial is available as a free pdf download.\r\n\r\ni apologize for the poor photo quality, it was captured from my 10+ year old, now defunct personal website. think of it as a piece of vintage internet crochet history. :-) \r\n\r\nthank you for all the crocheters who have written to me, over the years, saying how helpful they find this tutorial. \r\n\r\ni was shown this stitch by a friend about 20 years ago, and found it was difficult to understand from simply written instructions, but relatively easy to \"get it\" when shown the steps. so i took step by step photos with my old camera and scanned in the photos for a now very old (defunct) 90's website. \r\n\r\n",
