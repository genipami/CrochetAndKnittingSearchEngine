    "content": "a super cuddly scarf that is impossible to lose one end slips through the other to give the impression and feeling of being knotted but without the bulk one size fits most children between 3months and 3years of age the other extra special advantage is that it should only take a few hours from start to finish i make no particular recommendations as to the yarn you use but as this scarf fits so closely to the neck choose your yarn thoughtfully yarns that are too fluffy or scratchy will irritate for my sample i have used cleckheaton s merino angora silk 8ply in grey"
