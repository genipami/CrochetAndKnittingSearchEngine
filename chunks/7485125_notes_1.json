    "content": "this pattern is available as a free ravelry download those little jumpers don t need much wool but a lot of patience each of them is 2-3 hours of crafting if you are in a hurry or a total beginner maybe save this pattern for later as my 2023 and 2024 versions they are knit in the round starting with a white neck and the top part is used to insert the main colour and the increased stitches are part of the design they are very symmetrical starting with 16 stitches increasing in 3 steps to 2x16 3x16 and 4x16 the sleeves use 16 stitches each and the body the remaining 32 stitches to avoid the hassle of darning too many yarn tails only the main colour is used when the work is split in sleeves and body the pattern is mostly written with some pictures it contains 15 design suggestions respecting the design rules of the 2024 mini jumpers a white stitch cannot follow a white stitch except for starting a new row a white stitch cannot be knit on the top of a white stich except for first row after the neck white stitches are separated from each other by 1 3 5 or 7 stitches even numbers are not accepted this 2025 collection is exploring the 15 combinations doubling one or more edge lines of a diamond with no triple line i hope many of you will enjoy knitting them and post their pictures on this website happy crafting"
