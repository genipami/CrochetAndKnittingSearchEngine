    "content": "the cowl is worked in the round alternating colours each round working the pattern as described makes an infinity cowl which is long enough to wrap twice approx 108cm 21 inches long and 19cm 7 5 inches wide and it stretches the linen stitch is clever because although it is worked in row the stripes look like they are worked vertically also it is done in the round so no need to weave in tails at the end of each row just carry up the yarn using a couple of chains the stitch is quite dense so i suggest you go up a hook size from whatever is recommended on the ball band for drape i think this pattern will work best in dk weight or chunkier this is also a great pattern for using a short variegated yarn with a contrasting neutral or for using up some stash as you only need one ball of each colour"
