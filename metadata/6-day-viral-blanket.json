  "notes": "this blanket is a variation on the classic [6-day kid blanket][1] (6dkb). it was inspired by beautiful viral photos of 6-day kid blankets made by hanan hanaway, “crochet creations by hanan”.\r\n\r\nthis pattern gives instructions for a full-size blanket made with aran weight yarn and matches hanan’s iconic color choices.\r\n\r\ni have also included the camel stitch border hanan used - she caused quite a stir when she posted a photo of her unusual way of working all four rows at once. i’ve added my own special details - a straight start and squared off edge for a clean look, and symmetrical stripes.\r\n\r\nwhat is the difference between this pattern and other 6-day blanket patterns?\r\n\r\nthis pattern is very similar to the [6-day viral baby blanket][2], but i had quite a few requests for this variation in an adult size blankets. there are a few differences:\r\n\r\nsize: this pattern makes a full-size “adult” afghan. the original 6dkb was toddler sized and the viral baby blanket is even smaller.\r\n\r\nresize: the original pattern gives resize options, this pattern only gives one size.\r\n\r\nyarn: this pattern uses aran weight yarn. the original 6dkb uses chunky weight and the viral baby blanket uses dk weight.\r\n\r\nstripes: the original 6dkb is striped in the “vivid chevrons;” this pattern and the viral baby blanket uses“viral stripes”.\r\n\r\nedge: the original pattern had no edge or border. this pattern starts and ends with a straight edge, and has a border similar to the viral baby blanket of four rows of camel stitch. this pattern has shells one the last round, and the baby blanket has picots.\r\n\r\n**does it really only take 6 days to make?**\r\nthe original classic 6-day kid blanket was written for a toddler-sized blanket made with chunky weight yarn, and can easily be made in six days working an hour or two each day. this variation on the 6dkb uses the very same stitches as the original, but uses a different weight of yarn and is much bigger. it is possible to make it in six days if you have more than 2 hours per day to crochet. i think the average crocheter can complete it in about two weeks working an hour or two per day.\r\n\r\nsee my article, “[why is it called the 6-day kid blanket][3]” for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.bettymcknit.com/6daykidblanket\r\n  [2]: https://www.bettymcknit.com/6dkbviral\r\n  [3]: https://bettymcknit.com/2017/11/22/6-day-kid-blanket/"
