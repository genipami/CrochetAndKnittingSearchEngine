🧶 Crochet & Knitting Pattern Search Engine

A multimodal information retrieval system for PDF-based craft patterns

📌 Overview

The Crochet & Knitting Search Engine is an end‑to‑end information retrieval system designed to index, analyze, and retrieve crochet and knitting patterns from a large collection of PDF files.

The project focuses on applying:

✔ Information Retrieval (IR)

✔ Natural Language Processing (NLP)

✔ Text extraction from PDF patterns

✔ Embeddings & vector similarity search

✔ Basic classification / pattern type detection

…all toward solving a very real problem for crafters:

How do you quickly find patterns that match a stitch, yarn, or design style in a huge collection?

This project was built as part of my Master's degree coursework in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, and it reflects both academic concepts and personal interest (crochet is my hobby ♡).
