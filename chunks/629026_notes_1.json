    "content": "this cabled headband uses the easy 6 stitch cable pattern the cable helps the headband fit snugly because there is some stretch to it it is very easy to go down or up a pattern set to adjust the size it would be a good idea to measure the recipient s head if you are worried about the fit i have used the #5 bulky yarn for this pattern but i am sure a size #5 or #6 yarn will also work up well"
