    "content": "simple ds lite sleeve that i made out of a stitch pattern that a friend taught me i thought it was a cool simple semi-unique stitch until i googled and found out that it s called woven stitch and can be used for just about anything x anyway this is an extremely simple case that can have anything added onto it and gives easy access for charging low batteries the really cool thing about it is that it will fit over your ds in most medium to larger sized carriers which means extra protection for your ds lite against your stylus and your games there is one thing that i do need to add **this sleeve will not fit the original ds only the ds lite** if you re making this for someone else the original ds is larger only comes in silver and is older they are not in production anymore ds lites come in a variety of colors not silver as far as i know are smaller and have a brighter backlight they are the unit that is currently still in production"
