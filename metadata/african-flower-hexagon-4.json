  "notes": "i love this african flower hexagon crochet pattern! it was initially published in a south african magazine called \"sarie\", and instantly became a runaway success :) the pattern was designed by lounette fourie and anita roussouw. \r\n\r\ni have posted a step by step photo tutorial on how to crochet this hexagon, with a small modification of my own from the original pattern. they are very easy to crochet and beware...quite addictive!\r\n\r\n**[a quick update...the tutorial is now also translated into spanish!][1]** and french: thank you marie :) you can find the french translation here:\r\nhttp://dameennoir.blogspot.fr/2013/02/african-flowers-en-francais.html?m=1\r\n\r\nif you have any questions, please email me at heidibearscreativeblog@gmail.com, and i will try to help :)\r\n\r\nhappy crocheting!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://heidibearscreative.blogspot.com/2010/05/african-flower-hexagon-crochet-tutorial.html"
