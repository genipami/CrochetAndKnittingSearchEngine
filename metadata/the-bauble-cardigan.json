  "notes": "the bauble cardigan\r\n\r\nas with many of my designs, this design began with a simple inspiration that just wouldn’t leave me alone. the combination of simple double and half-double crochets, broken up with rows of bead stitches, always creates the perfect balance of texture and flow. for those who have been following me for some time, this stitch pattern may look familiar as i’ve used it in the past  (see bauble tee, banana cowl, slouch hat, gloves, and leg warmers).. naturally, i had to use this favourite again—this time in a cozy, stylish cardigan. i wanted something i could layer over my dresses for a soft, feminine touch but still throw on with a t-shirt and jeans for a relaxed, everyday look. once i started, i knew this round yoke cardigan was the perfect match.\r\n\r\nfinished sizes:\r\ninstructions given to fit size x-small; changes for small, medium, large, x-large, 2x-large, 3x-large, 4x-large and 5x-large are in () \r\nxs (s, m, l, xl, 2xl, 3xl, 4xl, 5xl) \r\nbody circumference: 28” (32”, 36”, 40”, 44”, 48”, 52”, 56”, 60”)\r\nfinished length: customizable. length on model shown is 21”\r\nsleeve circumference: 11\" (11 1/2\", 12\", 13\", 14 1/2\", 16 1/2\", 18, 19 1/2\" 20 1/2\")\r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\ni used go handmade yarns cosy, which is a 60% cotton, 40% acrylic, #3 dk weight yarn. \r\nany yarn of similar weight would work. \r\napproximately 600 (700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400) yds for the length shown. \r\n5.5mm hook\r\nstitch markers\r\nyarn needle\r\nscissors\r\nmeasuring tape\r\n\r\nthis pattern has been tested by a number of experienced crocheters and i have provided many pictures within the pattern to help you along the way. if you run into trouble you are free to message me for help.\r\n"
