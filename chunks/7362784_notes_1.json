    "content": "daisy can be made as an accessory or a free standing stem gauge is unimportant i ve only made this with worsted weight and have not tried it with lighter weight yarns requires less than one skein of yarn cotton recommended for the daisy petals bloom alone requires nothing more than basic crochet supplies including polyfiberfill stems require a dowel and hot glue gun"
