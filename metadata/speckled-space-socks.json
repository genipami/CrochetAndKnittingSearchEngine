  "notes": "many of the recent colorways to emerge from the imaginations of our favorite hand-dyers have been speckled, tonal, or semi-variegated. the colors are gorgeous, but many times, i find myself wondering what to knit with them that would show off the colorway but not drown out the pattern. inspired by speckled colorways, speckled space socks have an easy, textured pattern with some chevron shaping to add interest and minimal purling for speed. the pattern is written toe-up with gusset increases and a heel flap, but any heel could be substituted in, and the pattern is easily transferrable to a top-down format if that’s what you prefer.\r\n\r\nsize\r\ns (m, l)\r\n\r\nfinished measurements\r\nlength: customizable\r\ncircumference: 7.0 (8.0, 9.0) inches\r\npattern is written for 56 (64, 72) sts.\r\n\r\non choosing a size: testers found that the sock fit similarly to a plain stockinette sock on the foot but that it was more snug on the leg before blocking due to the 1x1 cables. you may find it preferable to increase needle size as you transition to the leg. i tend to prefer my socks a little loose and found that a 64 st sock worked well for me without changing needle size -- i use a 64 st sock for lace/plain patterns, 72 sts for some cables, and 80 sts for extensive cabling.\r\n\r\nneedles\r\nsize us #1.5 (2.5 mm) circular needle (32” / 82 cm or longer) or dpns for knitting in the round.\r\npattern is written for magic loop but is easily adaptable. use the needle size that gives you the correct gauge or that will give you your preferred fit.",
