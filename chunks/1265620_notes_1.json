    "content": "there are other versions of granny stripe i even did a cowl a few years ago this version is one i wrote specifically for a beginner crochet class and i wanted to make the it so there was only one relatively simple repeat row row 3 the fringe also can hide a few mistakes at the beginning and end if you happen to be learning you could use this same pattern to make a blanket if done wider if so i would recommend either a color changing yarn like universal major or changing colors to keep you from getting bored i am using american crochet terminology not uk for this pattern"
