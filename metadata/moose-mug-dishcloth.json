  "notes": "you probably know the national lampoon’s christmas movie “christmas vacation” (if not, you should watch it!). it’s my family’s favorite christmas movie so it is probably no wonder that while watching it, i got inspired to design and knit some dishcloth/washcloth for all of them. \r\n\r\nit's a very quick and fun knit which is also very suitable for last minute gifts.\r\n\r\n\r\n**materials**\r\n\r\nyou will need the following materials:\r\n\r\n* cotton yarn in your favorite color (roughly 85m / 50 g). i’ve used kurtenbach twister curly 8 uni (85m / 50g) \r\nyarn usage depends on weight and needle size. my dishcloth required 35g of yarn\r\n* matching needles for your yarn. i used a 2,5 mm needle, because i wanted to achieve a denser fabric. \r\n* tapestry needle\r\n",
