    "content": "sweater is known as a raglan which just means that increases are done at the corners rather than evenly around the yoke while a traditional raglan yoke has a square shape this pattern results in a pentagon to give it a v-shape on the front you can start your sweater with either fsc or chs the same number of stitches for either method the example sweater uses an fsc make enough stitches that the collar sits around your neck without being too tight in a multiple of 6 + 1 the example sweater has 73 fsc if you want a wide neck use a multiple of 8 + 1 if you want a deeper v-neck use a multiple of 6 + 3 or 8 + 3 sl to first fsc or chain to start working in the round you re going to want to mark the stitches where each corner will be the front and back should be twice as long as the shoulder portions or thrice as long if using a multiple of 8 divide your resulting stitch count by your multiple either 6 or 8 ignore the remainder of 1 or 3 this will be the number of stitches for the sides including your increase stitches for the example sweater this resulted in a shoulder width of 12 stitches for the first round count this number of stitches away from the sl and then mark the next stitch in the example sweater the 13th stitch was marked starting with the marked stitch as 1 count the same number of stitches and mark the final stitch in the example sweater the 24th stitch was marked each side of the v in the collar will also be the same number of stitches as the side count this same number of stitches and then mark either the next stitch if you added 1 or the second to next stitch if you added 3 in the example sweater the 37th stitch was marked count the same number of stitches again or that stitch count plus 1 if you had added 3 at the beginning and then mark the next stitch using this marked stitch as 1 count that same number and mark the stitch on which you ended in the example sweater this resulted in the 50th and 61st stitches being marked you should now have five stitches marked with an equal number of stitches for each shoulder and a front side that is either 1 or 3 three stitches longer than the back side and which has a stitch marked directly in the middle chain 1 turn your work turning before each new row results in a more even seam down the back this chain 1 will be the middle of the back of your sweater if you started with an fsc you can skip this part if you started with chs put a single_crochet in each chain making sure you move your stitch marker to your new corresponding stitch sl"
