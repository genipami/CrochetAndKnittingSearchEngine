  "notes": "four-legged sheep crochet pattern is an advanced beginner skill level amigurumi pattern with photo tutorial and video of the embroidery details. us terms and in english.\r\n\r\nthis pattern requires:\r\n#6 super bulky blanket yarn, 65-85 yards (90-100g) for the main color (i used blue).\r\n#4 medium yarn (worsted weight) 25-35 yards (15-20g) in the color white\r\n#4 medium yarn (worsted weight) 6-12 yards (4-8g) for hoof color and details (blue)\r\nsmall black thread for details\r\nfiberfill stuffing\r\nyarn needle\r\nstitch marker\r\n6.00mm crochet hook\r\n4.00mm crochet hook\r\n\r\nthe medium yarn i used is \"bernat super value\" in the colors \"white\" and \"hot blue\". the super bulky yarn i used is \"bernat blanket yarn\" in the color \"busy blue\".\r\n\r\nthere's only one size sheep in this pattern but of course your sheep or sheeps will be different sized with different yarn.\r\n\r\nnote that this pattern is meant to be made with both super bulky yarn and medium yarn and the 2 different size hooks and if your yarn or hook choices deviate from the pattern too much the sheep probably won't turn out as the pattern intends. if you use different yarn adjust hook sizes as well.",
