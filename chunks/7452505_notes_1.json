    "content": "this easy no-sew pattern is based on the original danish octo project octopus pattern i have made adjustments in terms of hook size round count and the attaching of the tentacles so that it would be easier to make and safer for the preemies if you are making it as a gift for someone who is not a preemie or a newborn feel free to use other types of yarn and hook sizes"
