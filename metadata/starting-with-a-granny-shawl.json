  "notes": "please do not use my photographs without my permission.\r\ni am not claiming this as my original pattern. the virus shawl has been around for ages and the virus meets granny is one adaptation. this is my version, which has fewer chains in row 1 of the virus and which starts with the granny section, hence the name. you have the ability to customize the pattern to some extent. as long as you work the rows of granny stitches in multiples of 4 and the virus section in its 4 row pattern, you can change the number of rows of the virus or granny stitch pattern to make something unique. i have also included a couple of alternatives for the final row to make the shawl look properly finished off. each of the 3 shawls i made is different. the pattern has lots of photographs to help with stitch placement. any yarn could be used with an appropriate size hook but my shawls were made with a variety of 4ply yarns."
