  "notes": "a super cute baby beanie. you’ll find that these beanies fly off the hook. make them as gifts, for your market stall, or for charity. pair them with a pretty filet baby blanket. top them with a pom pom and add earflaps for some extra cuteness. use one or more colours to add your personal touch to the design.\r\n\r\n***please note: my stitches are quite tall. if your beanies are turning out a little short, please substitute dc rounds for hdc rounds.***\r\n\r\ninstructions for a number of design variations are provided.\r\nthe pattern mostly uses beginner worthy dc and chain stitches. \r\nany dk/ 8ply acrylic, cotton, wool or mixed fibre yarn can be used. beanie size can be adjusted by using a thinner or thicker yarn. other resizing tips provided in the pattern document.\r\n\r\nyou can make a matching adult beanie with the vintage vibes beanie pattern: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/vintage-vibes-beanie.\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy making these cute little hats. remember to add your project on ravelry and #vintagevibesbabybeanie your posts on social media, so i can see all of your lovely makes.",
