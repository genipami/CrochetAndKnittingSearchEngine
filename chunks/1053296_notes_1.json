    "content": "the moss stitch is my go-to stitch whenever i want to crochet something easy i wrote this pattern for a dishcloth using the moss stitch because i think the fabric created from this stitch is a great option for a dishcloth it is also a great option for a simple but elegant blanket if you re looking for mindless crocheting i think it looks so beautiful with multicolor yarn but it will also look really good with a solid color"
