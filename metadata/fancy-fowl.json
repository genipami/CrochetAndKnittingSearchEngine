  "notes": "the emotional support chickens that swept through the fiber community last year clearly left their mark on me. i was smitten!\r\n\r\nwanting a version of my own in tunisian crochet, i used the original knit design as inspiration and adapted it with this result. a whimsical, textured bird that’s full of personality and charm.\r\n\r\nthis little chick features a distinctive, fan-like tail section that’s both fun to make and delightfully eye-catching. perfect for gift giving or just brightening up your craft space, each fancy fowl is a joy to create from start to finish.\r\n skill level: intermediate\r\n\r\nfinished size: \r\napproximately 7” (18 cm) long × 6” (15 cm) tall\r\n\r\ntag your photos with *#fancyfowltc* so everyone can admire your flock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
