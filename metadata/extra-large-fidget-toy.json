  "notes": "i have seen a bunch of tiny crochet fidget toy patterns, and those are great for stealth fidgeting, but i got interested in making a bigger, fluffier one! because of the mobius construction you can pull the ruffle through the center opening – well, forever.\r\nthis type of crochet fidget toy has a couple of extra benefits – it’s soft and pretty, quiet to pay with, unbreakable, and washable when you make it in acrylic yarn like i did!"
