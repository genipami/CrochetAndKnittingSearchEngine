  "notes": "**this is a pay what you want pattern! use the code washcloth50 for 50% off the original price or use the code washcloth100 for a free copy. if you download for free, i’d love it if you gave this pattern a ❤️. thank you for your support!\r\n\r\nintroducing the *parallel universes washcloth* — a delightfully simple yet striking knit that’s perfect for both beginners and seasoned stitchers looking for a relaxing project. worked from corner to corner, this washcloth features a clever diagonal construction that creates a sleek parallelogram shape, adding visual interest without any extra complexity. the easy, repetitive stitch pattern makes it an ideal mindless knit for unwinding at the end of the day, while the unique shape gives it a modern twist. quick to finish and satisfying to make, this washcloth might just become your new go-to gift or household staple.\r\n\r\nthis beginner-friendly pattern is designed with worsted or aran weight yarn and 5mm (us 8) needles, but feel free to use any yarn and needle combination you like! it’s a simple, flexible project that you can easily customize to any size by adjusting the number of increases and decreases. i've provided instructions for the exact size i made, but you’re encouraged to experiment with stitch counts and gauge to suit your own preferences. gauge is not crucial in this pattern.\r\n\r\nwhat makes this washcloth stand out is its unique construction. it’s worked diagonally, from one corner to the other. you’ll start with a basic cast-on and rapidly increase along one edge, forming an asymmetrical triangle. once you reach the desired width, you’ll begin decreasing along the opposite edge, shaping the piece into a modern, eye-catching parallelogram.\r\n\r\nthe design features a clean, faux i-cord edging that gives the washcloth a polished, structured look. the design is simple and soothing to knit—made up entirely of garter stitch, increases, decreases, and a faux i-cord edge. the only slight variation comes at the cast-on and bind-off, where you’ll use a couple of easy finishing techniques to add polish to the final piece.\r\n\r\nalthough the pattern notes right and wrong sides for clarity, the finished piece is fully reversible—there’s no true “front” or “back.”\r\n\r\nthe final result is a beautifully textured, functional washcloth that looks much more complex than it really is. it’s perfect for beginners or anyone in need of a relaxing, satisfying knit. best of all, it’s quick—you can finish one in just an hour or two. and to make things even easier, i’ve included video tutorials for any special techniques, so you’ll have support every step of the way.\r\n\r\nthank you for choosing my pattern, i hope you enjoyed it. if you enjoyed this pattern, you may be interested in some of my other patterns–you can check them out [here][1] :) you may sell as many of the finished items as you wish, but if you share on social media please give me credit @elly donner on ravelry and link the pattern to its source. if you have any questions or need pattern support, please contact me [here][2] @stopitharry on ravelry. i appreciate your support!\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/designers/elly-donner\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/people/stopitharry"
