  "notes": "can't figure out what to knit with that single skein of sock yarn in a variegated colorway that you've had in your stash for months? here's the answer! \r\n\r\nthis pattern was specifically designed to work with the variegation of colors, instead of getting obscured underneath the color changes. one skein of fingering weight yarn is enough to complete a shawl, and the pattern is easy to modify to compensate for slight variations in yardage. \r\n\r\ni've not added a gauge, as i feel there is no one catch-all gauge for this pattern. use needles that gives you a fabric that you like - you'll want the fabric to drape, but not be seethrough-airy, adjust needle size if necessary. heavier or lighter yarn weights can also be used for this pattern, though dimensions and yardage will change. change the number of garter and mesh section rows to alter size if necessary. \r\n\r\nmeasurements of sample on photos (blocked): 148 cm / 58 inches along top edge (longest edge), 55 cm / 21½ inches from middle of top edge to center tip. \r\n\r\noriginal yarn used in this pattern was miss babs cosmic hand painted sock, colourway gal noir. \r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n**translations:**\r\n\r\n* czech: [pattern available via this link][1], credit goes to ravelry user vevka for translation!\r\n* french: pattern available for download via the download button on this page, credit for translation goes to ravelry user atelierfibrelaine!\r\n* german: pattern available for download via the download button on this page, credit for translation goes to ravelry user fluseundfussel! \r\n\r\n* [hungarian][2] thanks to raveler nicolette kernohan, aka the knitting squirrel.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n**note on pattern use:**\r\n\r\nsince i've received a fair few requests for permission to print or host this pattern for free, or to translate it, here is a blanket permission: \r\n\r\nfeel free to host or otherwise provide this pattern for free, as it is, as long as i get credit for the design - be it hosting on a website, providing printed copies at a store or a meeting, or bundling with yarn.\r\n\r\nfeel free to sell items made with this pattern. \r\n\r\npattern translations are welcome too - i only request that the pattern not be modified in any way, i'll be happy to add the translated pattern to this page and give credit for translation. \r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n**updates:**\r\n\r\npattern has been updated on 25.06.2015. if you have downloaded pattern on that date or before, please re-download the pattern to receive the correct version. previous version of the pattern was missing a section of mesh and garter stitch after row 28.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\npattern has been updated on 21.07.2015 to include total stitch counts at the end of each section. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://vlnenesestry.blogspot.fi/2016/03/jarni-knit-along-s-vlnenymi-sestrami.html\r\n  [2]: https://www.theknittingsquirrel.com/reyna-shawl/"
