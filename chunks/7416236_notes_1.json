    "content": "the **hands off canada** mittens are a reaction to the political landscape of early 2025 it is my hope that with this mitten pattern and the attached charts i can provide canadians and allies a means to not only show their pride and support -- but also to work through their frustration without resorting to endless anxious doom-scrolling hopefully the somewhat repetitive but also challenging colourwork can help distract -- or focus -- you this pattern is *not* tech-edited or tested this is more of a general recipe with some charts that is based off of the traditional norwegian selbu mittens and so this pattern is somewhat difficult if you have never knit that kind of pattern before i recommend looking up one of the many amazing videos explaining how to knit selbu mittens on youtube if this is you an adventurous beginner has to start somewhere and selbu mittens are very easy once you crack the code edit wow i am blown away by the response thank you all for your messages and kind words we are definitely living in interesting times but it is so reassuring to hear from people all over responding with support and care happy knitting and elbows up **pattern information ** make sure you have the latest versions of the charts yarn - any sport weight or heavy fingering yarn with approximately 50g of **white** main colour and 50g of **red** yarn contrast colour consider using yarn produced in canada or owned by a canadian company an example of this is briggs and little which produces yarns like *sport* or *durasport* that are very similar to the one i used a more accessible option since they are usually available at michaels is patons who have yarns like *kroy sock* that could work instead of the yarn i used you can also ask for advice from your lys to help find a canadian yarn that will work best for this kind of pattern and is similar to what i have from rauma garn i have used rauma finull which has 175 metres per 50 g ball needles - 2 5 mm either circular or dpns gauge - 28 st by 30 row per 10 cm in pattern colourwork i knit somewhat loosely go up a needle size if you knit tightly and want the same sized mittens as me your gauge swatch can be the wrist chart but do pay attention or else you will be gifting your pair to someone with smaller or larger hands although maybe that s not a bad thing there is a typo in the recipe document it should be 30 rounds where it says 15 rounds sizes - one size but definitely more for adult women my pair are 11 cm wide and 26 cm long including the wrist 19 cm without it i like mittens to have positive ease and be looser on my hands so that they will fit me through heavy use and washes mittens tend"
