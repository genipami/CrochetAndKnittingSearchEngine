  "notes": "**pattern notes**\r\nwhen someone knit-worthy requests something, it only makes sense to oblige. that was the case with these socks – heather’s mother wanted a cozy yet hardy basic pair of dk-weight socks. the towanda socks are the result. they’re even named after the town where her mother grew up. quick to knit – you’ll want to knit a pair for everyone you know (including yourself). \r\n\r\nthe towanda socks are knit from the toe up with a heel flap and gusset. in this pattern, all slipped stitches are worked purlwise with yarn in back.\r\n\r\n**sizes**\r\nadult medium\r\n\r\n**finished measurements**\r\nfoot circumference: 8”\r\nfoot length: adjustable\r\n\r\n**materials**\r\n[**universal yarn** *deluxe dk superwash*][1] (100% superwash wool; 100g/284 yds)\r\n•\t861 teal rustic – 1 ball \r\nneedles: us size 4 (3.5 mm) set of dpns or size needed to obtain gauge\r\nnotions: stitch markers, tapestry needle\r\n\r\n**gauge**\r\n24 sts x 34 rows = 4” in st st \r\nsave time, check your gauge.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://universalyarn.com/quality_color.php?quality=379"
