    "content": "as baby blankets go sasha is an absolute classic simple blocks of stockinette and reverse stockinette create sleek modern stripes this combination also results in a reversible pattern - something i know a lot of knitters look for when making baby blankets for this particular blanket i ve gone for a soft gender neutral pale grey but i think it would work in any colour you wanted to use - even using a variegated yarn would work really well gauge is not important as long as it remains consistent"
