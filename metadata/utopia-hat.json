  "notes": "i was looking for a hat with lot of texture and didn't really find anything i liked, so created my own. this hat is worked in one piece, top down. the crown has posted stitches every x stitches, then it blends into the main fpdc/dc texture of the hat, and there's fpdc ribbing for the edging. gauge isn't overly important, but the finished hat should fit a standard adult head.\r\n\r\nenjoy! :)\r\n",
