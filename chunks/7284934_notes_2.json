    "content": "knit the sweater **use of colors** to lighten the text the use of colors is explained below and you ll need to change your colors as you go along following the model s instructions this sweater is entirely worked by doubling 2 yarns and alternating colors every 16 rounds to form stripes where the colors blend together you would for example use two strands of color a to knit one stripe a & a replace one of the two strand a with b to knit the next stripe a & b then use two strands of color b for the next stripe b & b and so on therefore i suggest winding your skeins into a cake so that you can use both ends of the yarn the one coming out from the center of the ball and the other unwinding on the outside this way you can use both ends of the same ball when knitting the stripes with two strands of the same color knit the neckline and short row with a & a then follow the sequence below 16 rounds with a & b 16 rounds with b & b 16 rounds with b & c 16 rounds with c & c 16 rounds with c & d 16 rounds with d & d 16 rounds with d & a 16 rounds with a & a repeat the sequence from the beginning note that this sequence is suggested for those who wish to knit a version identical to the illustrated pattern but i still invite you to experiment with your own mix of colors and stripes you could opt for a version with more or fewer colors and change the order of the colors to suit your mood before knitting the first sleeve the most important thing is to separate your remaining colors into two equal halves a scale is recommended for this so that you can knit an identical second sleeve la version fran\u00e7aise de ce patron se trouve sur leslainesbiscotte com 2 1 https //biscotte org/merica 2 https //biscotte org/capemay"
