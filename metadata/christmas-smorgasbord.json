  "notes": "this mystery knit-along will end up with a pair of socks on christmas eve. there will be a new part released each day in december (1-24). the idea is to use leftover yarns, mini-skeins, or an advent calendar worth of yarns to knit these. that said, you could also have a lovely pair of socks with a single yarn. if you choose that option, your best plan would be to use a solid, semi-solid, or tonal yarn. \r\n\r\nthis is a beginner-friendly and relaxed pattern and knit along. no one needs extra stress during december! that said, every part of the pattern is different, so it shouldn't be boring to experienced knitters.\r\n\r\nthere will also be flexibility as to how long to knit each day's section so as to adjust for desired leg and foot length.\r\n\r\nknitalong will be hosted in the [fgf: the sock group][1].\r\n\r\n**note: i am updating the pattern each day. it will be too complicated to find what you want if there are 24 separate pdfs.**\r\n\r\n**materials:** approximately 100 gms of fingering weight sock yarn. \r\n\r\n**gauge**: 8 sts and 11 rnds = 1 inch\r\n\r\n**sizes:** 7 (8, 9, 10) inch circumference\r\n\r\n**note:** if you want to add more fun to this mystery knit, wrap up 24 small balls or skeins of yarn and unwrap one each day to knit the next portion of the pattern. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/groups/fgf-the-sock-group"
