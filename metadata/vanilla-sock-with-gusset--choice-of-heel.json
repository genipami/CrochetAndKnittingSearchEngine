  "notes": "this pattern is for a basic toe-up sock with a gusset and reinforced heel flap, suitable for both men and women.  there is a choice of style of heel flap – standard heel stitch or eye of partridge.  although there are detailed instructions given for four sizes, there is also a section that explains how to use this as a starting point for a smaller or larger sock.  along the way, as well as instructions there will be explanations – why you’re doing something rather than just telling you what to do.\r\n\r\n**sizes** - measured around mid foot\r\n\r\n* small – 6.5”/16.5cm unstretched, 8”/20.25cm stretched \r\n* medium –  8”/20.25cm unstretched, 10”/25.5cm stretched  \r\n* large – 9”/22.75cm unstretched, 11”/28cm stretched\r\n* extra large - 10\"/25.5cm unstretched, 12\"/30.5cm stretched\r\n\r\nbecause the pattern provides the formulae for you to make your own calculations in addition to the four sizes detailed, you will also be able to use it for socks using different weight yarns or a different knitting gauge.\r\n\r\nmany thanks as ever to my lovely testers - alicepayne, anitaknits, bjtmoc, chath, dctangles, earthmom23, ellyb, fitznstarts, gailr, karendidit, knitnglo, lucy27lucy, msnewknit, queenofallknits and ruatha.\r\n\r\n**update 14th october 2014**\r\nfollowing a number of requests i've added a new \"standard\" size - extra large - so those of you that want to knit larger socks from these instructions won't need to do your own calculations any more.\r\nthis new size hasn't been officially tested, but it has been proof read by someone who's knit more socks from this pattern than i have, and we do know that people have already made socks this size using the diy calculations.  \r\nif anyone does follow this new size and wants to give some feedback, please feel free to message me or add a comment.\r\n\r\ni’d love it if you’d come to [my group][1] to show off your lovely socks, or chat about them while you’re making them. you’d be very welcome!\r\n\r\n> read on [my website][2] how to adjust\r\n> this pattern to provide extra\r\n> reinforcement for walking/hiking/boot\r\n> socks.\r\n> \r\n> use this [on-line calculator][3] to\r\n> help you with the calculations for\r\n> where to start the gussets and [this\r\n> one][4] for all the other calculations\r\n> (how many to cast on, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/groups/jo-torr-designs\r\n  [2]: http://www.jotorr.co.uk/reinforcement-for-walking-socks/\r\n  [3]: http://www.jotorr.co.uk/sock-gusset-calculations-2/\r\n  [4]: http://www.jotorr.co.uk/vanilla-sock-calculations/",
