    "content": "i know that not everyone likes knitting moss stitch i m not going to try and convince avid moss stitch-avoiders to try this shawl despite the wonderfully snuggly textured and well-behaved reversible fabric that all-over moss stitch offers but if you enjoy gentle rhythmic knitting with very little thought required this might be for you this is an entirely flexible pattern in terms of size yarn choice and gauge the shawl is boomerang-shaped with sets of eyelet row at the colour changes an optional section of short row to further increase the wingspan of the shawl and a picot cast off it can be made huge and wrappable like mine which has a 2 7m wingspan or much much smaller gauge is not important but choosing a needle size that gives you a fabric you like is the key- loose enough to create some drape is important the pattern name reflects the approximate number of species of moss across the world"
