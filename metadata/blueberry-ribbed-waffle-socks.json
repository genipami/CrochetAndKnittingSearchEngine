  "notes": "from the designer's notes:\r\n\r\n> \"these are a good in-between weight for wearing around the house and under boots. the ribbed waffle pattern helps the socks stay up quite well, and because of the stretch, they will fit a woman's medium to a man's medium foot without trouble.\"\r\n\r\nthere are variations available to change the gauge of the pattern. i've made the socks in several different weights from fingering to worsted weight. \r\n\r\nlisted as \"[ribbed waffle socks knitting pattern][1]\" on the knitting on the net website.\r\n\r\npreviously available at knitlist: http://web.archive.org/web/20080324044632/http://www.knitlist.com/98gift/blueberrysocks.htm\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.knittingonthenet.com/patterns/sockswaffle.htm"
