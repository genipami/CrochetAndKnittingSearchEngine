  "notes": "the star of these gloves is the linen ridge stitch. the way it is incorporated resembles the textured patterns on the treads of tires, and so that’s how these lovelies got their name. \r\n\r\nsuitable for both genders, this is a versatile pattern that can be easily modified to fit smaller or larger sizes.  it could also be easily modified to make full-fingered gloves, fingerless gloves, or even mittens.   my original treads were knit with berroco palace, a light aran weight yarn. you may find you achieve gauge with lighter yarns.   \r\n\r\npattern updated november 12, 2011 to further clarify lateral braid instructions.",
