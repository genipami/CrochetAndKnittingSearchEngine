  "notes": "this pattern is a tiny version of my regular window cat pattern.  \r\n\r\nit's 3 inches tall, worked in the round, and all in one piece except for the tail. the only seaming is to attach the tail to the side of the body.\r\n\r\ni've tried it with various yarn sizes from fingering to dk weight, and used size us 1 dpns with all of them.  they all came out great.\r\n\r\n"
