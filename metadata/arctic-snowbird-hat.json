(see finished measurements below.) the hat is charted, and separate written instructions are included. all repeats appear in bold text.\r\n\r\n**yarn**\r\napproximately 80 yards/ 73 meters of super bulky weight\r\nyarn (shown in [malabrigo rasta][2] in fog)\r\n\r\n**gauge**\r\ncable stitch, blocked\r\nworked on us 15 (10 mm) needles\r\n12 stitches & 13 rows = 4”/10 cm x 4”/10 cm\r\n\r\n**needles**\r\nfor co and brim: us 11 (8 mm) 16”/41 cm circular needle\r\nor shorter, for working in the round, or a needle 2 sizes\r\ndown from the needle size you make gauge with\r\nfor hat: us 15 (10 mm) 16”/41 cm circular needle or\r\nshorter and a set of dpn's for working in the round and\r\ndecreasing crown\r\n\r\n**notions**\r\n1 stitch marker for bor\r\ncable needle\r\ntapestry needle\r\nblocking materials & measuring tape\r\n\r\n**finished measurements**\r\n(laying flat & blocked)\r\ndepth: 8.5\"/22 cm\r\ncircumference: 18\"/46 cm\r\n\r\npattern difficulty\r\nadvanced beginner\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/designers/kalurah-hudson\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/malabrigo-yarn-rasta\r\n",
