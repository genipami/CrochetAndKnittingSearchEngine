    "content": "designed as an easy to wear layer when you want the warmth of a cowl and hat but don t want to carry too many accessories push the hood back to wear as a cowl or put it up to wear as a hood with your favorite winter coat the pattern was originally published with the feza harvest name the company recently rearranged its lines as of june 2017 harvest is now sold under the urth label rather than feza so when you are looking at your lys you may find harvest under either label for a while the yarn itself is the same right down to the color names i called the company today to verify"
