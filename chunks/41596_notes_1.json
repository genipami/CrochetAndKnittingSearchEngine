    "content": "i purposefully left the hook yarn and gauge areas blank for this pattern because i have made it in everything from fingering to worsted weight yarn the pattern suggests hooks and gauges for some choices the pink scarf in the picture is karabella breeze cashmere/silk the gold one is tilli thomas disco lights silk/sequins i have also made it in cascade venezia worsted merino/silk and someone else made it in eden bamboo yarn the pattern is easy especially if you are comfortable with symbol crochet diagrams which are included for the ends please note this pattern uses u s crochet terminology"
