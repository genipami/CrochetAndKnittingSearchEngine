  "notes": "the \"fingering yarn cozy\" is a small knitted pouch that holds a caked skein of yarn of fingering / sock weight so that it cannot unwind by itself. if the caked yarn is used up from the middle, the yarn cozy holds the ball together until the end.\r\n\r\nthe yarn cozy is knitted like a small cap that is pulled over the yarn. because of the rib pattern the yarn cozy is flexible and can be stretched to pull it over the yarn and contracts easily around the yarn, afterwards. in my example the yarn cozy measures 10cm in diameter and is 9cm high when filled with yarn.\r\n\r\nfeel free to [get me a virtual coffee][1] \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/heathlandknits"
