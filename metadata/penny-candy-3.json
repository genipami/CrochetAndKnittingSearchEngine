  "notes": "this simple side-to-side crochet pattern creates an easy triangle shawl that gives you a variety of options for playing with color. the sample combined a solid color with a colorshifting yarn to offer a gradual movement of color across the entire work. you could combine two solid colors for a tonal look, use up scraps paired with a single skein of a solid color, or just play with bits and pieces to create something brand new. \r\n\r\nto change size, use bigger or small yarn and a matching hook. alternatively, do more increase rows, which will be matched with more decrease rows.
