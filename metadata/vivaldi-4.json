the four seasons. the project begins with a foundation that establishes a strong, textured panel, structurally linking to subsequent clues. your journey will explore a diverse range of knitting techniques, alternating between delicate lacework and rich, dimensional texture using a shifting palette of hues. as the year progresses, you'll encounter motifs representing the crispness of winter, the freshness of spring, the warmth of summer, and the deep texture of autumn. the entire project culminates in a final geometric piece before all sections are united and crowned with a decorative final border, completing this yearlong masterpiece.\r\n\r\nyour entire vivaldi project will be knitted using oasis camel silk dk, a truly luxurious and irresistible yarn. this exotic, sultry blend of 50% camel fiber and 50% mulberry silk provides unmatched softness and a silken glow.\r\n\r\n* click [here][9] to watch a video about this month's clue.\r\n* the blanket used approximately 1,258 yds (1,150 m) total – c1: 183 yds (167 m), c2: 188 yds (172 m), c3: 211 yds (193 m), c4: 98 yds (90 m), c5: 43 yds (39 m), c6: 85 yds (78 m), c7: 48 yds (44 m), c8: 95 yds (87 m), c9: 48 yds (44 m), c10: 83 yds (76 m), c11: 23 yds (21 m), and c12: 153 yds (140 m). these yardages only include the amounts used in the clues themselves. extra yardage used as colorwork will be specified in the respective clue notes.\r\n* **very important: you will need to keep the leftover partial skeins, as you will need some of them later in the pattern.**\r\n* this blanket is inspired by the different stages of a day and the four seasons. you will begin this project by initially working in the round. by strategically placing increases, the round shape is transformed into a square. you will continue to work in the round until the desired diameter is reached. then you will work along the four edges of the square, each one representing one of the four seasons of a year. uniform decreases on both sides of each quadrant will create a triangle, which will become your new square tip. an ornamental border is added by picking up stitches around the square.\r\n* all slipped stitches are slipped purlwise if not otherwise noted.\r\n* lifelines are a very helpful tool in this project. please take advantage of them in the lace portions of the design.\r\n* beads are optional for clue 2, but are required for clue 3.\r\n* clues 4 and 8, and 6 and 10 are interchangeable. if the instructions of one of the clues are too challenging, you can substitute it with another one at any time.\r\n* the same is true for clues 5 and 9, and 7 and 11. substitute one of them with another one at any time.\r\n* please make sure to carefully read every clue’s specific note before starting each clue.\r\n* because i am a rather tight knitter, i highly recommend checking your gauge against mine to ensure that you have enough yarn to complete the design and reach the desired measurements.\r\ngauge is crucial to this project, since some clues use almost all of the yardage given in a skein. please make sure to be on gauge to not run out of yarn.\r\n* each clue’s notes include unblocked and blocked clue measurements. these are mainly for you to keep track of tension while working on your clues and to avoid running out of yarn. please adjust your needle size up or down if you significantly deviate from the specified numbers.\r\n* you will block your piece after clue 11. the sample was blocked rather aggressively to open up the lace sections and reach the dimensions.\r\n* the pattern uses 12 colors, but can be made with more or fewer, if preferred.\r\n* the pattern includes written instructions, as well as charts for some of the clues. \r\n* for instructions on how to place beads, check out this [video][10].\r\n* this [video][11] shows how to add a lifeline.\r\n\r\n*designed by johanna huck*\r\n\r\nyou'll receive a digital file only (instantly downloadable as a pdf) and won't be
