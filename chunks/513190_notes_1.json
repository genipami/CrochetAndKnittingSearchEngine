    "content": "oh the dilemma how to knit in the freezing cold wear wristers i wanted a wrister long enough to keep my arms warm and my fingers free to knit or read or eat chocolates so this is what i came up with a beautiful but simple gansey pattern that looks great in a solid color i chose anzula squishy because it s well squishy it s such a beautiful yarn and the color is so rich i had the lucky opportunity to meet sabrina and her friend lacey at the anzula trunk show at annie & co in ny and they were wonderful at helping me pick out the perfect yarn thank you and thanks to verna and pat for mentioning that i should put a flap over the wristers to turn them into mittens i will work on that next"
