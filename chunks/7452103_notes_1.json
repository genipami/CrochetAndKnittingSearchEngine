    "content": "packers are used within the lgbtq+ community they are used frequently by people who desire a more masculine presentation they give the illusion of a bulge in the pants which can bring about gender euphoria i made this pattern because i had a lot of extra sock weight yarn and couldn t find a pattern to make a packer with it the packer is knit primarily using stockinette stitch with some shaping using increases and decreases it is made of pieces and then seamed together the seams add to the shaping in particular adding on the tip using a running stitch gives the appearance of foreskin there are options for shaping your packer you can use blocking and short row to create a packer which naturally points downward the simpler design will point perpendicular to the backing piece that is meant to sit against the body the instructions are very malleable if you would like a larger or smaller packer than the pattern provides the pattern as written gives a packer that is approximately 6 inches from the top of the shaft to the end of the tip there are detailed instructions on assembling the shaft tip and balls so they all have the desired shaping i hope this brings you comfort this pattern will have a free listing and a paid listing so that it is available to all but if you d like to pay for the pattern you have that option"
