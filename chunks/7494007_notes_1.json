    "content": "this is a pattern for a filet crochet tapestry it is just like any other filet crochet chart and you can even use this in other ways such as for knitting color work *this is also my first ever pattern so it is very very bare bones with a small intro info & the chart * **this has also not been tested aside from my own test - so please let me know if there are any errors or issues with any part of the pattern/chart** the gauge may vary depending on the craft you apply this to i am making this with a lace weight yarn size 10 and a 1 5 mm crochet hook i would consider this an ambitious beginner-level pattern depending on the craft you apply it to if you know how to crochet then filet crochet should come easy to you with a bit of practice if you re using this for crochet or knitting and know how to do color work or duplicate stitching then it should be relatively easy and you can just skip to the chart there is an embedded link to a blog page on how to filet crochet which i highly recommend if this is your first time trying filet crochet or if you need a refresher this pattern is also very bare bones as stated earlier so i highly recommend looking up different finishings to do around the edges to make it more personalized"
