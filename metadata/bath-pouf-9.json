  "notes": "introduce a new bath pouf to your home spa experience by stitching rounds of double crochet that ripple-up on themselves to complete your piece. create this unique accessory in any shade of lily sugar’n cream scrub off with its alternating sections of exfoliating texture. it's a fun project to work on, and a great item for a spa-themed gift basket."
