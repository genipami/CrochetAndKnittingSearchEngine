  "notes": "i love the simplicity of a granny square, but decided to try something a bit different for this one.  i’m using what is know as the crochet brick stitch to create the modern granny afghan.  i also didn’t want the typical square that a granny usually produces, so i’ll walk you step by step with photos to show you how to crochet a rectangle shaped blanket.\r\n\r\ni used caron cakes in the cake pop colorway for this project, but feel free to use any worsted weight yarn in your favorite colors to create many fun looks.  this would be a great pattern to use for your favorite sport team colors to use at those chilly games.\r\n\r\nfinished size is 52? x 64? using 6 caron cakes.  if you would like a baby version of 35? x 42?, only 3 cakes needed.\r\n\r\nfor more patterns and tutorials, visit [the crochet crowd][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://thecrochetcrowd.com/"
