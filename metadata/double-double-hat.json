  "notes": "when i was 7 years old, our family moved from singapore to canada. it’s the first airplane trip i can remember. i believed i was leaving the city to live on a farm where i would wake up each morning to collect fresh eggs from our chicken coop. as it turns out, moving to vancouver meant something completely different. i lived in a house, the same as the one i left behind; i went to school, just like i did before; and we ate... donuts for breakfast? our family quickly acclimatized to a new culture which included neighbourhood block parties, building snowy toboggan tracks in the cul-de-sac, and double double coffee (not for me until many years later, but still... donuts for breakfast?!).\r\n\r\nthis basic knit hat is an homage to early mornings with family. two layered hat, two ways to wear it, two creams, two sugars.\r\n\r\nthere are 7 sizes included in the pattern.\r\n**preemie (baby, toddler, child) {teen, adult s, adult l}**\r\nhat circumference: 10 (13.25, 15.5, 17.75) {18.75, 21, 22}“ / 25.5 (33.5, 39.5, 45) {47.5, 53.5, 56} cm\r\n\r\n1\" - 2” / 2.5 cm - 5 cm of negative ease in the hat circumference intended\r\n\r\n*note: this is a free pattern intended to give knitters an idea of what a wwk pattern looks like. it has not been test knitted or professionally tech edited. if you have questions or feedback, please email me at the address listed below. *\r\n\r\nknitting for olive - merino, “dark cognac”\r\n\r\n199 (325, 417, 498) {559, 650, 693} yds / 182 (297, 381, 455) {511, 594, 634} m of light fingering weight yarn.\r\n\r\n*please be advised that yarn requirements and finished size measurements are approximate. actual values may vary based on garment size, yarn, needle size, and gauge.*\r\n\r\nthis pattern requires knowledge of:\r\n* reading patterns with multiple size options\r\n* knitting in the round\r\n* increases and decreases\r\n* magic circle cast on (tutorial included)\r\n\r\nfor pattern support or feedback, email [wintersweatherknits@gmail.com][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: mailto:wintersweatherknits@gmail.com",
