  "notes": "this pattern is crocheted using bulky yarn such as big twist or lion  brand jiffy bulky yarn or 2 strands of worsted weight yarn held together. if using bulky yarn you will need appox 93-100 yards or just under 3 ozs. if you are using worsted weight yarn you will need between 186 - 200 total yards of yarn.\r\n\r\nif you crochet tightly, use a n (9 mm) hook. if you crochet loosely, use a  k hook to crochet this hat pattern. see notes about if you should crochet 11 or 12 rounds before adding trim."
