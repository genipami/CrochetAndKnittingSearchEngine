    "content": "pattern for norwegian selbuvotter which i designed after seeing someone wearing mittens with a pattern similar to this i made these for my little sister but they were so pretty i had to make myself a pair too the size is easily changed by switching needle size as outlined in the pattern this pattern isn t too tough and uses pretty big needles and yarn compared to many norwegian mittens so it s a good start for someone who wants to try making a traditional norwegian mitten for the first time 2 skeins of yarn needed one of each color any yarn is ok i prefer 100% wool because it blocks so nicely and is so warm but you can use superwash or merino if 100% wool makes you itch"
