  "notes": "this pattern is available as a free ravelry download\r\nthose little jumpers don’t need much wool, but a lot of patience, each of them is 2-3 hours of crafting.\r\nif you are in a hurry or a total beginner, maybe save this pattern for later.\r\n\r\nas my 2023 and 2024 versions, they are knit in the round, starting with a white neck, and the top part is used to insert the main colour, and the increased stitches are part of the design.\r\n\r\nthey are very symmetrical, starting with 16 stitches, increasing in 3 steps to 2x16, 3x16 and 4x16. the sleeves use 16 stitches each, and the body, the remaining 32 stitches.\r\n\r\nto avoid the hassle of darning too many yarn tails, only the main colour is used when the work is split in sleeves and body\r\n\r\nthe pattern is mostly written, with some pictures.\r\nit contains 15 design suggestions. \r\n\r\nrespecting the design rules of the 2024 mini jumpers:  \r\n\r\n• a white stitch cannot follow a white stitch, except for starting a new row\r\n• a white stitch cannot be knit on the top of a white stich, except for first row after the neck\r\n• white stitches are separated from each other by 1,3,5 or 7 stitches, even numbers are not accepted!\r\n\r\nthis 2025 collection is exploring the 15 combinations doubling one or more edge lines of a diamond, with no triple line.\r\n\r\ni hope many of you will enjoy knitting them and post their pictures on this website.\r\n\r\nhappy crafting!",
