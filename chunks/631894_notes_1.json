    "content": "this pattern would work with pretty much any yarn and appropriate hook you want the hook to be relatively small in comparison to the yarn so that you have very little gaps for the stuffing to peek out i ve called it a brussel sprout but i m pretty sure with a slightly different coloured yarn you could easily call this lettuce or cabbage you ll only need scraps of the yarn some stuffing i use washed old pillow stuffing and some googly eyes if you re only glue gunning the eyes on be aware that it won t be suitable for little ones"
