  "notes": "each year, i knit socks for my family.  i love using leftover yarn and every year i think of a different way to use it.  i wanted to share this year’s recipe with you all and i hope it makes you and your loved ones happy!\r\n\r\nenjoy this free pattern!\r\n\r\nthis pattern is written as a top/cuff down construction.\r\n\r\n\r\nyarn and notions:\r\n\r\nyarn:  100g fingering weight yarn  (350-425 yards / 320-390 metres) total\r\n*(i suggest 50-70 g of a main colour and 10-15g of each contrasting colour)\r\nsamples in leftovers of super sock (75% merino 25% nylon) by tippy tree yarns\r\n\r\nneedles: \r\n2.25 mm needles with a long cable for magic loop\r\n\r\nother notions: stitch markers, scissors, darning needle\r\n\r\ngauge: 8-9 sts = 1 inch / 2.5cm in ribbing with the smaller needles (2.25 mm)\r\n\r\nsizes: (*choose a size that is slightly smaller than your foot circumference for a snug fit)\r\nsmall, 56 sts, finished circumference 7 inches\r\nmedium, 64 sts, finished circumference 8 inches\r\nlarge, 72 sts, finished circumference 9 inches\r\n\r\nnotes:\r\n\r\nthe instructions are written for 3 colours. you may of course decide to knit these socks in only one colour by simply ignoring the instructions for colour changes. you can also use just one contrasting colour, or even multiple colours, as you prefer!\r\n",
