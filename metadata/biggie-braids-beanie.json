  "notes": "description:\r\n\r\nthis knitted hat pattern creates a beautiful and intricate braided pattern. it knits up quite quickly and it is written for an advanced beginner/ intermediate knitter. this pattern is worked from the brim up and is knitted in the round. some basic knowledge of knitting cables will be helpful but you are just a youtube video away from learning, give it a try, it is actually pretty easy and very rewarding! \r\n\r\nthis hat knits up really beautifully! it has amazingly squishy braids, but they lay nicely and are not too bulky on the head, and it can be adorned with or without a pom-pom! \r\n\r\nskill level: advanced beginner/ intermediate\r\n\r\nsize: adult\r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\n-yarn: super bulky weight, i used malabrigo rasta\r\n-needles: us 11 and us 13 circular needles\r\n-other: scissors, stitch marker, optional dpns, tapestry needle",
