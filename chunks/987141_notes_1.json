    "content": "a well written pattern to make a bluey amigurumi toy if you are a mum like me who enjoys bluey you can make one for yourself i think it all comes down to how tightly you crochet and how well you are able to assemble the parts yes they killed my hands but i m beyond happy about how it turned out i would suggest you buy skeins of three different shades of blue before you start just to make sure you get the right shades of blue"
