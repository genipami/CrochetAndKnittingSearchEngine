  "notes": "called the citrus hat for the way the decreases create the appearance of a citrus fruit, this is a pretty basic hat pattern that works well with pretty much any yarn and can fit multiple head sizes. \r\n\r\nit looks great in handspun or commercial yarn, and in solid, semi-solid, or variegated colorways. the combination of knits and purls used throughout the hat means it is very accommodating of different head sizes and a good match for kids that keep growing. \r\n\r\nwhile the pattern is written for worsted-weight yarn, it’s easy to adjust for different yarn weights, and the pattern includes some helpful hints for yarn modifications. \r\n\r\nthe pattern includes sizes for baby, toddler, child/teenager, small adult, and large adult hats.\r\n",
