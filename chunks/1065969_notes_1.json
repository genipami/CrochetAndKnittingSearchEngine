    "content": "i love three button cowls they are so versatile because they can be worn in so many different ways this pattern works up very quickly but i think it really makes a statement the cowl is simply a rectangle with three buttons sewn on this really is more of a recipe than a strict pattern i give you the number of stitches in each row and the number of row that i did but you can certainly increase or decrease either of them to change the size you can also use a different type/weight of yarn and adjust the hook accordingly i prefer a bulky or super bulky yarn for these cowls simply because it makes them extra squishy and cozy"
