    "content": "i made these cute small trees as a quick present and i just fell in love with them so i thought i would share it with you the crown and the trunk are knitted first then i sewed a fabric on the back and stuffed it i attached the tiny pines on a crocheted chain to create a garland you can use any kind of cord for this last step or just hang your trees individually size approximately 6 cm tall and 4 cm wide gauge honestly i didn t count the gauge as the size of the trees doesn t really matter you can play with different yarn weights and needle sizes to create smaller or bigger trees however it is important to have tighter gauge so the filling won t be seen through needles i used 3 5 mm needles yarn different kinds of scrap yarns i used mostly dk and worsted weight scraps but it would be really beautiful with fingering weight and smaller needles to create tiny pines notions waste yarn tapestry or darning needles sewing needles scrap fabric wool or small pieces of yarns for filling"
