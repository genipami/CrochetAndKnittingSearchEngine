  "notes": "crochet moss stitch (sometimes also called granite stitch or linen stitch) is an incredibly easy and beautiful stitch. in this variation it is worked on the bias, or from corner to corner (c2c). the fabric created is wonderfully stretchy and has a lovely drape. this pattern works beautifully with variegated yarns to disperse the colors randomly. it also works well with gradient stripes to create a subtle shift from color to color.\r\n\r\nthe pattern will help you create a square or rectangle of c2c moss stitch in any size of your choosing.\r\n\r\n***video tutorial is now available!***\r\n\r\nvisit me, polly plum, get help or support, and stay up to date on new patterns by: [checking out my website][2], everytrickonthehook, for things like tutorials and free patterns; liking [every trick on the hook on facebook][3]; following [polly_plum_crochet on instagram][4]; visiting [polly’s place on ravelry][5]; or get lots of help and support from the facebook group, [polly plum pattern posse][6].\r\n\r\nyou can see all of my patterns on my [designer page on ravelry][7].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://wp.me/p6otoq-nx\r\n  [2]: everytrickonthehook.com\r\n  [3]: https://www.facebook.com/everytrickonthehook/\r\n  [4]: https://www.instagram.com/polly_plum_crochet/\r\n  [5]: http://www.ravelry.com/groups/pollys-place\r\n  [6]: https://www.facebook.com/groups/pollyplumcrochetpatterns/\r\n  [7]: http://www.ravelry.com/designers/polly-plum"
