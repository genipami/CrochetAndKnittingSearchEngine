  "notes": "how to crochet a fan lace scarf! this stunning scarf looks complicated but is in fact, a very simple and easy 3 row repeat! \r\n\r\nmade entirely in one piece, it shows off your variegated yarns beautifully. if you are looking for something a little bit different to crochet that has the “wow” factor, then this is the scarf for you!"
