    "content": "i got a lovely yellow primrose from a friend i thought that i have to make a shawl inspired by primroses but actually this reminds me more of tulips hence the name - as wikipedia tells liliopsida is a botanical name for the class containing the family liliaceae or lily family this is a simple shawl for the spring one skein of fingering weight yarn is enough yay the size is adjustable - you can make longer lace edging"
