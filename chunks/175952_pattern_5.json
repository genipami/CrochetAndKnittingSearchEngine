    "content": "where the side seam would be if this were a seamed sweater once you have reached the desired length bind off if you do not want your hem to curl you must insert some sort of ribbing or flat-lying pattern before binding off if you re using ribbing use a needle one size smaller to do so knitting the sleeves slip one set of sleeve stitches onto a 16 long circular needle pick up the added stitches under the arm and start knitting the sleeve *note if you want to shape the sleeves you will have to experiment with decreases and spacing generally decreasing one stitch at the beginning and end of the round every inch works well you can continue this all the way down the sleeve or stop at the elbow to create a bell sleeve you can also play around with increases to create a bloused sleeve just remember to write down your process so that you can repeat it on the second sleeve eventually you want to have your desired # of cuff stitches on the needle so keep that in mind as you re decreasing x = g a u g e cuff circumference cuff stitches the same note about the curling of the hem applies to the sleeves so if you don t want that to happen choose a flat-lying stitch pattern and use it before you reach the desired length sleeve if you re using ribbing use a needle one size smaller to do so bind off and weave in all your ends knitting the collar pick up every stitch along the neckline the cast on edge and knit up a collar there are many variations 2x2 ribbing seed stitch etc but for the sake of uniformity you may consider matching the body and sleeve hems to the collar there are some wonderful books published recently that showcase beautiful edge details and many of them can be applied to this type of sweater to jazz it up page 6 variations we ve hinted at a few of the variations that you can make to this basic pattern but there are so many it might make your head spin just keep the sweater recipient in mind as you re making these decisions necklines and collars try making a boat-neck version of this sweater all you need to do is measure the collar circumference you d like to create making sure that it s big enough to get over your head use the worksheet to figure out your back/front/sleeve stitches but instead of casting on the way that is described on page 5 cast on all at once and start knitting in the round right away you won t need any a markers if you d like to make a v-neck cast on just as is described on page 5 but work the neck front differently instead of increasing the front every other row increase at the beginning and end of every 4 to 6"
