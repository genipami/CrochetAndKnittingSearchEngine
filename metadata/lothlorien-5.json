  "notes": "i designed the rivendell shawl for my first book, journey, a few years ago. although it was a crochet pattern, the inspiration was born from my visit to the remaining set of the lord of the rings movies you can find in new zealand. i have always been fascinated by the tales and books of j.r.r. tolkien. the stories include so many details and layers that getting lost in a different world might be easy. to continue the journey, i have used another place out of the lord of the rings to inspire a knitting pattern: lothlorien, home of the forest elves. there is much to tell about this place and this race; therefore, i have created several parts in this pattern, which all tell a little background about certain things that connect to this theme. so, prepare yourself for a journey through middle-earth once more.\r\n\r\n**yarn requirements:** for this pattern, i used one scheepjes whirl. a whirl comes in cakes of 215-225 grams and has a length of 1000 meters. the yarn is made of 60% cotton and 40% acrylic. i used colorway 560 jade jim jam for my version. you won’t use the entire whirl; approximately 900 meters of yarn will be used.\r\n\r\nhaving some scrap yarn in contrasting colors by hand may also be helpful to add lifelines to your work between the parts. take a scrap yarn with the same condition or weight as the one you are knitting. \r\n\r\n**knitting needles needed:**in this pattern, you will use 3.5mm circular needles with a length of 80cm/32 inches.\r\n\r\n**size:** the longest side of the shawl will be approx. 64 inches and the depth of the shawl will be 30 inches.\r\n\r\n**gauge:** scheepjes whirl: 27 sts and 33 rows of stockinette measure 10x10cm (4×4 inches) with 3mm needles.\r\n\r\nas this is a lace knitting pattern, several common stitches and terms are used. when not familiar with knitting stitches, please refer to the internet as all are explained in so many videos and tutorials. \r\n\r\nthe pattern is made up of six parts that let you explore the story behind the knitting pattern.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is free; you can download your pdf file in english and dutch.\r\n\r\n\r\nit seems there were a few typos in part 4 of the pattern i missed. the pattern has now been updated with these minor changes. the following typos were detected:\r\n\r\nenglish version:\r\n\r\nr2 and all even rows - a k1 after the repeats were missing.\r\nr25 of the charts isn't accurate to the written instructions because there are some extra stitches before and after the repeat - which aren't shown in the diagram.\r\n\r\nnederlandse versie:\r\n\r\ner waren wat kleine dingen in deel 4 van het patroon die ik over her hoofd heb gezien. dit zijn:\r\n\r\nt2 en alle even toeren misten een 1r na de herhalingen.\r\nt25 in het diagram is anders de geschreven instructies. dit komt doordat er wat extra steken voor en na de herhaling zijn die het diagram niet toont. \r\ner was een klein typefoutje in de herhaling. dit moest niet t1-20 zijn maar t1-10\r\n\r\n"
