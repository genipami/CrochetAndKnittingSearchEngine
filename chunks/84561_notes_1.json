    "content": "parul is a versatile crocheted scarf constructed in a series of steps from three skeins of yarn it can be worn in a variety of interesting ways the triangular base construction allows it to be tucked down into the neckline protecting your throat and upper chest without adding too much bulk under a jacket it also wraps and ties in the manner of a cravat or can be worn casually over top of a coat the pattern was written using american crochet terminology but includes an information section for those more familiar with european conventions the scarf is made with three skeins of yarn from light dk to worsted weight 80 - 150 yds per skein and details are included in the pattern that help to adjust for differing yardage about the name - i did a search in the world baby name directory online using the word practical because that s how i see this scarf within my wardrobe and it returned only one name parul but the full definition was practical beautiful gracious that said it all much better than i could have don t limit yourself to thinking of this scarf for winter wear only my first parul was made from berroco seduce yarn which is a linen / silk / rayon blend i keep that one handy for times when a bit of a breeze livens up a sunny afternoon or the air conditioning is just a touch too efficient since then i ve made heavier one in a cotton blend and plan another in a lovely warm wool tweed i hope you enjoy your parul as much as i do mine rebecca logan thatloganchick designs"
