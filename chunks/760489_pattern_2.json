    "content": "lot about this very simple motif if you re crocheting along go ahead and make one note us terminology used throughout step 1 chain 4 slip_stitch into the first chain to form a ring step 2 chain 3 counts as the first double_crochet of the round step 3 15 double crochets into the ring slip_stitch into the beginning double_crochet fasten_off easy enough but making just one of these is well kind of boring how about making a whole bunch of these motifs and joining them together sounds interesting but\u2026 what would be the most efficient way of doing this the first obvious answer is to join one motif to the others as it is made to try this for yourself start another very simple motif but but with these slight variations step 1 chain 4 slip_stitch into the first chain to form a ring step 2 chain 3 counts as the first double_crochet of the round step 3 7 double crochets into the ring now join this motif to the first one you made step 4 slip_stitch into any double_crochet of the first motif step 5 8 double crochets into the ring step 6 slip_stitch into the beginning double_crochet fasten_off 3 that certainly is a possible solution but hang on a minute look at those yarn ends for some sewing in these pesky tails is the most tedious job in the history of mankind and should be avoided at all costs i have a friend that would rather crawl through the bowels of beelzebub than thread a sewing needle never mind let s try something else what if once you finish one motif you just go right on ahead and start working the next one without breaking the yarn to test this idea make a brand new very simple motif but for now do not fasten it off now start another very simple motif straight away starting with the chain 4 ring step 1 as you can see the chain 4 ring ends up being connected to the previous motif in totally the wrong place it s sitting right against the edge of the first motif and not leaving any room for the double_crochet that s supposed to be in-between if you were to go ahead and finish this new motif anyway you would find that it ends up overlapping the previous motif rather than sitting flush next to it like we want it to interesting idea it s just not what we re after right now let s try yet another idea instead of making the chain 4 ring first how about working a double crochet first and then making the chain 4 ring go ahead i dare you to figure this one out 4 obviously we re stuck again how do you make a double_crochet when there is nothing to make the double_crochet in to this is a classic case of trying to put the cart before the horse a lot of you right now are going to"
