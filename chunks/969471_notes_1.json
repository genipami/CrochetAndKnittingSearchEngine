    "content": "the verna puff hat pattern is part of a matching winter crochet set last month i released the verna puff infinity scarf and the verna puff ear warmer patterns since then i have received numerous requests for a hat pattern this hat is worked from the bottom up to the top we begin working in row like the earwarmer pattern and then we switch to continuous rounds after the puff section the hat is fitted to the top of the head if you would prefer to make this a slouch hat it is very easy to do simply continue making your repeats see r11-r18 until you have the slouch you want every 2 rounds will give you one extra inch of hat height then finish your hat using the decrease rounds i hope you love making and wearing this super soft hat best wishes rhondda xo"
