  "notes": "the [better dorm boots slippers](/patterns/library/better-dorm-boots-slippers) has been a hit, i thought i'd better put out the directions for the mens version as well.  \r\na better “dorm boot”. made the same way as the traditional dorm boot, knit flat and seamed at the end. these knit up fairly fast - i can knit one slipper in 2 hours.  with yarn held double throughout, these are super plushy.\r\n\r\nstitches used include, knit, purl, sl-1, psso, k2tog, p2tog, k3tog, ssk.\r\n\r\n\r\n“like” kriskrafter on facebook for updates on new patterns, discussions, etc. [kriskrafter][1]\r\n\r\n* a shout out and huge thank you to anne goodwin for helping me by testing each of the sizes for this pattern.  :)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.facebook.com/kriskrafter"
