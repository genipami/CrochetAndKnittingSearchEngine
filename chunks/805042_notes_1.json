    "content": "i have been spending time in the pacific northwest recently and am in love with the brickwork on the buildings this simple knit/purl pattern creates the texture that reminds me of the architecture in the pnw this hat has a simple 6 stitch and 6 row repeat that is designed to keep it interesting while being easy to memorize this hat can be adjusted to fit any size head or knit gauge by casting on multiples of 6 if you want a shorter or taller hat you can simply increase or decrease by knitting multiples of the 6 row repeat you can even stop after row 3 if the hat is the right size the measurements in this pattern are meant to be guidelines please keep measuring your hat as you knit so that it doesn t become too large different yarns a different knit gauge will all affect the actual size of the hat so use this as a template do stop after row 3 or row 6 when the hat reaches the right size for you"
