    "content": "this pattern is for everyone who like me has bought a wondrous skein of hand-dyed sock yarn and then picked it up and put it down a hundred times looking for the perfect pattern which will make the colors pop i ve also unvented a new moebius cast-on that will allow you to directly translate your own colorful skein into almost exactly the correct number of stitches to match the color changes in your skein if you cast on for two rounds of your skein you will be able to wear it as a cozy shoulder wrap or alternatively knit it in just one single round of the skein to make a cozy neckwarmer or even a long snood as the season changes to winter notes * knitty has embedded a video of the cast-on into their pattern page the brioche stitch makes for a warm and squooshy fabric which is perfect for an extra layer of warmth in the winter or just a nice wrap for cooler fall or spring evenings there are many tutorials for the brioche stitch so i will only use common brioche abbreviations instead of giving instructions for the brioche stitch once you ve done your cast-on and added your second solid color this project becomes a reasonably easy knit with no pattern needed your fingers will soon remember how to do the brioche stitches and all you need to pay attention to is how the colors align as you make your stitches"
