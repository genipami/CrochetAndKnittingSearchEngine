  "notes": "yas! it’s time for **y**et **a**nother **s**tockinette hat!\r\n\r\nthis simple pattern is worked top down so you can use every single yard of a special yarn - the sample uses a cashmere blend, but this would work well with any light fingering yarn. perhaps you have a special skein of sock yarn you've been holding onto?\r\n\r\nstarting with dpns, you’ll switch to circulars before finally using a tapestry needle to graft the live bottom stitches to the main body of the hat, forming a warm doubled-up brim.\r\n\r\n**tutorial for grafting stitches**\r\ni made a little video tutorial for grafting the live stitches into the body of the stockinette hat here: https://youtu.be/dvo1llkfuys\r\n\r\n**other techniques used**\r\ncasting on & knitting in the round with a small number of stitches: https://rebeccadanger.typepad.com/rebecca_danger/2012/03/tutorial-tuesday-casting-on-with-a-small-number-of-stitches-on-dpns.html\r\n\r\nmake one right (m1r) and make one left (m1l):\r\nhttps://blog.tincanknits.com/2013/10/03/m1/\r\n\r\n**errata**\r\nround 4 instructions should be completed on each needle, increasing 8 stitches every other round. pattern has been updated.\r\n\r\n**adapting this pattern**\r\nhere’s a fun tidbit i’ve learned about my own head: regardless of the weight of the yarn, once the “center square” reaches 4” per side, i can stop increasing and just knit straight until the hat is long enough for the brim. now that i know that, i can use this same concept to make a hat from any weight of yarn. \r\n",
