    "content": "this unisex socks pattern features an intricate diamond design that reminds me of eye-catching argyle prints without all those pesky color changes i love this pattern because it s subtle enough to be worn everyday yet the diamond design adds a touch of sophistication the socks are knit in a classic top down method with standard 1x1 ribbing at the top a stockinette heel flap and a rounded wedge toe finished off with kitchener stitch to close this pattern is completed using size us1 knitting needles and fingering weight sock yarn i chose to use premier yarn wool-free sock yarn as i m allergic to wool but any fingering weight yarn would work the pattern is free on my blog but if you prefer to purchase a pdf of the pattern you can do so in my etsy shop https //www etsy com/shop/knitpaintsew"
