    "content": "the pattern is now available online 1 and as a free ravelry download from the pattern for the last few holidays i ve tried to focus on giving handmade gifts but one of my biggest problems with holiday knitting is that sometimes you have to give a gift still on the needles i like patterns that are easily memorized but hold my attention span i designed these socks so they have an intriguing lace repeat and are quick to knit i like to think that i know my friends and family well enough to give them gifts they will enjoy but i know that sometimes i miss the mark not so with these socks my friends and family love the undulating pattern one friend commented that they reminded her of tadpoles swimming through the water all at once i was picturing myself knitting by the side cool pond on a hot summer day not a bad daydream for the middle of winter if you received the pattern prior to 6pm 4/24 there is an error in the written lace chart please download a new copy 1 http //blackswandesigns files wordpress com/2009/04/tadpoles2 pdf"
