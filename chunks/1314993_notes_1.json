    "content": "this quick and satisfying project looks so much more complicated than it really is if you can knit and purl you can make this no fancy color work required each round is worked in a single color while your second color waits at the beginning of the round to be worked a perfect quick gift project you can easily make this in a long afternoon especially if you have some scraps laying around as it takes such a small amount of yardage it is worked seamlessly in the round from the bottom edge up i prefer to use a tubular cast and bind off as it gives a very polished finish without too much fuss"
