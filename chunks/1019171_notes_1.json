    "content": "this simplistic toque made with seed stitch will become a staple to your market prep this has been one of my best selling items so i thought i would share with you how to make it it is simple enough to make and once you get the hang of it you can manipulate the pattern as you see fit techniques to know knit purl cast on work in the round transfer stitches to yarn gauge it is not crucial for this project but if you find the end product to be a bit to big or small then it is best to size up or down based on the sizing chart included in pattern sizes there are 8 sizes available in the pattern going from 0months to adult+ yarn amounts amount of yarn required varies depending on what size you are doing and what yarn you are using 1 ball or skein of yarn will be enough to do your project the only exception is the adult+ size using malabrigo rasta or the wool as you may need 2 skeins/balls as the yardage is a bit less in these fit the fit of the toque is designed to be fitted and majority of adults fit the regular adult size as the final product has a good amount of stretch this is a free pattern and has not been sent to any pattern testers so please be easy on me and if you note any problems or discrepancies don t hesitate to reach out to me"
