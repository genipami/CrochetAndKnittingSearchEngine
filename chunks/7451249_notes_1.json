    "content": "the gauge given for this pattern is based on the sample shown but gauge isn t important the pattern doesn t involve any counting it s done entirely based on measurements and you only increase in the first several rounds those increases are at the same interval every round so you don t have to count stitches at all likewise the one decrease round is done by skipping a stitch every so often--again without counting stitches that construction makes this pattern a great option if you want to work quickly especially since it s intended for bulky yarn or if you want to use a fluffy or fuzzy yarn that makes stitches hard to see the sample shown was made using a strand of cirro from the fibre co and a strand of lace weight mohair together however any bulky yarn that will work with a size k 6 5 mm hook will do"
