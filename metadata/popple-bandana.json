  "notes": "we love a good bandana in warmer weather—and this one is just that! it's lightweight both in the knitting and in the wearing—and it's a fun-to-work slip stitch pattern in an easily memorized eight-row repeat. \r\n\r\npack one for your travel knitting and take a finished bandana for your vacation wardrobe too—it's the perfect piece for just a little something plush and colorful around your neck!\r\n\r\nsamples shown\r\ncompleted bandana: elmer in color cashew and birdie in color plaid is my favorite color.\r\nin-progress sample: elmer tweed in color fir and birdie in color picnic.\r\n\r\nsizes\r\none size.\r\n\r\nfinished measurements\r\napprox. 52\" wingspan by 13\" deep, after blocking.\r\n\r\nyarn requirements\r\n*please note these are yarn estimates. the amount used will depend on yarn, your personal gauge, and any modifications you make.*\r\nmc: the lamb & kid elmer (80% merino, 20% cashmere; 400 yards per 100 grams) or the lamb & kid elmer tweed (70% merino, 30% cashmere; 410 yards per 100 grams): 1 skein.\r\ncc: the lamb & kid birdie (74% alpaca, 26% silk; 328 yards per 50 grams): 1 skein.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\ntwo fingering-weight yarns in the following amounts:\r\nmc: 240 yards / 220m,\r\ncc: 105 yards / 96m.\r\n\r\nas ever, we invite you to play—this is a great pattern to use your stash—use multiple colors and work ripple stripes, or use all your leftovers and make it scrappy!\r\n\r\nneedles\r\n*needles listed are suggested.*\r\ngauge needle: us 6 (4mm) 24\" / 60cm or 32\" / 80cm circular needles.\r\n\r\ntools\r\ndarning needle.\r\n\r\ngauge\r\n*gauge is not critical for this project although it may affect yardage requirements; you want a finished fabric with drape and body.*\r\napprox. 22 sts and 26 rows=4\" in ripple slip stitch pattern using gauge needle, blocked. \r\n\r\nerrata, version 1: the stitch count after working border rows 1-3 is incorrect. the parenthetical note should read: border rows 1-3: … (2 sts inc’d, 285 sts on needle)\r\n",
