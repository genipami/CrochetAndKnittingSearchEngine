  "notes": "(description from magknits.com)\r\n*the zigzagging motif of these socks reminds me of jaywalking in boston - right, left, then right again! the jaywalker pattern is both visually interesting and simple enough for a beginner. it is suitable for solid, self-striping or variegated yarns - large portions of straight knitting allow color segments to remain distinct. the stitches are placed on a bias, which creates a snug, droop-less fit. jaywalking while wearing these socks is entirely optional!*\r\n\r\nthe toe up version of this pattern (written by a different designer) is no longer available.",
