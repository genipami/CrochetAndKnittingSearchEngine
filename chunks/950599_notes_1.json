    "content": "these fingerless mittens are knitted in the round from the cuff up to the top and have an arched gusset that allows for a very comfortable fit they are cute warm and very practical for cold weather months i use them when taking my dogs for a walk going out early in the morning to feed the chickens or to bring some firewood in these mittens have a very simple colorwork design so if you have never knitted with 2 colours before this could be a perfect first project for you mittens are knitted on circular needles however you can also use double-pointed needles if you are more comfortable with them"
