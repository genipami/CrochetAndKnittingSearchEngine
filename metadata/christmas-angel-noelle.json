  "notes": "**noelle, christmas angel 2025** is a 9-inch standing crochet angel worked with medium worsted weight yarn and a 4 mm (g) hook. she’s crocheted in one piece from the top of her head to the base of her dress, which gives her a sturdy shape without any stuffing or stiffening. her arm and wings are made separately and added at the end.\r\n  \r\nnoelle is quick to make and takes less than two hours from start to finish. she stands on her own and makes a sweet addition to your christmas décor or a thoughtful handmade gift.\r\n  \r\n**if you enjoy crocheting angels, you can find the rest of my free designs here:** [oombawka's angels](https://oombawkadesigncrochet.com/crochet-angel-patterns-free/)\r\n  \r\n**this pattern is available for free on my website which is monetized by ads. if you prefer an ad-free version of the pattern it is available to purchase from my pattern shop.**\r\n  \r\n♥ rhondda\r\ninstagram: [https://www.instagram.com/oombawkadesigncrochet/](https://www.instagram.com/oombawkadesigncrochet/)\r\npinterest: [https://www.pinterest.com/oombawkadesigncrochet/](https://www.pinterest.com/oombawkadesigncrochet/)\r\nyoutube: [https://www.youtube.com/oombawkadesigncrochet](https://www.youtube.com/oombawkadesigncrochet)\r\nfacebook: [https://www.facebook.com/oombawkadesigncrochet/](https://www.facebook.com/oombawkadesigncrochet/)\r\n  \r\nnewsletter: [https://oombawkadesigncrochet.com/crochet-newsletter](https://oombawkadesigncrochet.com/crochet-newsletter)\r\n  \r\n© 2012-2025, designed by rhondda mol (oombawka design crochet). all rights reserved. you may sell finished items you crochet from this pattern. no part of this publication may be reproduced, altered, or distributed in any form, or by any means, without express written permission from rhondda mol."
