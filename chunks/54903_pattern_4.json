    "content": "are two methods that i know of that can be used to sew fabric to the back of the shirt but you are welcome to think up your own methods if they would make the process more simple for you method #1 is to spread the shirt front-side-down front-side being whichever side you choose to be the front on a flat surface and then spread the fabric over the back pin it to the edges and cut away the excess fabric with about an \u00bc remaining to be tucked under method #2 which i use and greatly prefer is to gently stretch the shirt out to the degree that it will be stretched when worn and pin it front-side-down to a cardboard box or any flat surface that you can get your pins into and then spread the fabric over it pin the fabric down as well and cut away the excess fabric along the edges of the shirt here again leaving the approximate \u00bc of extra fabric to tuck under as you sew either method that you choose the actual sewing is very much the same the fabric should be stretched over the back of whichever parts of the shirt that you want lined and cut along the outside edges beginning anywhere you like use a hidden stitch to sew the fabric to the row of single_crochet edging on every side making knots every five or six inches so that if the thread ever breaks you will not have to re-line the entire shirt the hidden stitch is worked by choosing a place to begin and there securing the end of your thread to the back of a single_crochet *tuck the fabric under so that the cut edge disappears between the fabric that you see and the crochet so that the crease of your tuck lays against the row of single_crochet then snag a bit of fabric along the crease by pushing your needle into the crease directly above where you secured the end then pushing it back out of the crease just a bit to the left or right if you are left-handed of where you pushed it in now snag the backs of approximately 2 or 3 single_crochet by pushing your needle through the backs of them beginning directly below where that you came out of the fabric repeat from * around the entire shirt with more elaborate tucks required at the corners if you have excess fabric showing from the front you can stop sewing about 4 or 5 inches away from where you began and tie off securely turn the shirt wrong-side-out through this gap and trim away the excess fabric wherever necessary turn the shirt right-side-out and sew up the gap with hidden stitches if necessary cut away the excess material along the newly sewn gap by reaching your scissors in through the front of the shirt but be careful as it is difficult to repair a severed crochet stitch at this point designed"
