    "content": "this hat is knit from the bottom up on double pointed needles with a 12 stitch pattern repeat suitable for a beginning cabler looking for a simple first project or a more advanced knitter looking for something that knits up quick this is my first attempt at writing a pattern so feedback is very much appreciated **needles** one set of double pointed needles for the main body of the hat i used us #7 s use whatever you re comfortable with and gives you a gauge you re happy with one set of slightly smaller double pointed needles for the ribbing at the brim and finishing the decreasing on top i used a us #5 but it doesn t matter too much what size you use as long as they re a little smaller one significantly larger needle for casting on i used a us #10 5 alternately you could use two of your double pointed needles held together **yarn** i used jo sharp classic dk wool for this project but any dk weight should be fine if you have sensitive skin you would probably want to go with something much softer than regular 100% wool you might be able to just squeak by with one ball of yarn for the small but i d recommend two to be on the safe side and for the larger sizes **gauge** i would recommend knitting a test swatch of one pattern repeat with at least a little extra fabric on each side the 12 stitch pattern segment should measure about 1 \u00bd inches across unstretched and about 2 inches gently stretched to get the hat sizes small 20 inch medium 22 inch and large 24 inch with that said this is a one size fits most type of pattern so chances are you ll be all right if you d prefer to just start right in"
