  "notes": "**about the pattern**\r\n\r\nthis is a detailed pattern for a simple crescent shawl that shows off your craftsmanship and the beautiful color progression of long-gradient yarns.\r\n\r\nit's symmetrical, wide and relatively shallow (when compared to a simple triangle shawl), so you can wear it as a triangle scarf on colder days and as a wrap on summery evenings. \r\n\r\nit's the perfect project for social events (if you like to crochet in public) or for evenings spent watching your favorite show, as it requires only little concentration. \r\n\r\nonly one cake of yarn is necessary for this pattern, so your project is portable and you can take it with you anywhere, on trains, planes and the passenger seats of a car. \r\n\r\nuse any yarn you have in your stash that has a long gradient, such as one of the suggested yarns, which have 800-1000 meters per 200 grams, or pick some yarns from your stash that make up the same 800-1000 meters and use your color mixing skills to make your own color blocks or gradient.\r\n\r\nthere is no gauge for this pattern because you work on your shawl until it's large enough for your needs or you run out of yarn. so use a hook that helps you crochet easily with your chosen yarn and that makes uniform stitches. \r\n\r\nyou can use a 3 mm hook, 4 mm or even 5 mm and you'll still end up with a beautifully draping shawl. the secret for this is in the bias construction.\r\n\r\n**the best part about this pattern? it comes with both written instructions and a chart in the pdf version.** after several rows you get the hang of it and can continue on your own. \r\n\r\nthe pattern has been tested by several lovely people (check out their photos) and the final version has been released on may 1st 2019.\r\n\r\n**easy read**\r\nthis pattern includes two files in an easy read or mobile friendly format which respects the following requirements:\r\n\r\n24 point arial font; 26 and 28 point and bold for headings. \r\nblack text, white background.\r\nleft justified, 1 inch margins. \r\nno columns.\r\npage numbers bottom left.\r\nno charts.\r\nall abbreviations explained in the list.\r\nall images have alt text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://yarnandy.com/raspberry-croissant-shawl-free-crochet-pattern/\r\n  [2]: https://youtu.be/-d5mxjtskx0\r\n  [3]: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\r\n\r\n\r\n"
