    "content": "this is an alternate version of my no-sew heart when developing the original pattern i wanted a pattern for a stuffable knitted heart that didn t include now knit another and sew them together this heart is cast on and knit in the round from the bottom tip up to the centre v then split each heart bump is worked independently and gathered after stuffing the only sewing is a stitch or two in the middle of the v to close the small gap this version has a little trick after the first heart bump that will leave only the beginning and ending tails to weave in it has fewer stitches and a better shape than the original https //www ravelry com/patterns/library/no-sew-heart and is faster to knit this is the version i use for knitting charity heart pairs there is a dk weight pattern and a chunky yarn version which has even fewer stitches but honestly you can use any yarn and a smaller needle for that yarn than you would usually use and it will work the size will vary but that might be useful you should easily be able to incorporate the textured or subtle texture instructions see my page for details if that style is preferred you can download this from my blog for free and if you like it feel free to leave me a tip or buy me a ko-fi i would sure appreciate it https //scrappystickyinkymess wordpress com/about/"
