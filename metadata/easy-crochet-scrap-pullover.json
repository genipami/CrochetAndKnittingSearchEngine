  "notes": "materials\r\n\r\nscrap yarn – how much yarn needed all depends on what type of yarn/weight you choose for your pullover. one of the versions i made is made up of various 100% acrylic medium weight/worsted (4) yarns and the other is made of up left over 100% cotton medium weight/worsted (4) yarn. don’t be afraid to mix brands~!\r\n\r\ni used 400grams for the acrylic version and 365grams of yarn for the cotton version.\r\n\r\n6.00mm crochet hook – you can size up or down in your hook depending on how “mesh-like” you want your sweater.\r\n\r\nscissors\r\n\r\ndarning needle\r\n\r\nstitch markers – (i personally don’t use a stitch marker for this pattern, but if you easily lose track of where you started or are a beginner, stitch markers are very helpful.)\r\n\r\npattern notes\r\n\r\n*this pattern can be made in any size. i will be giving the basic instructions of how i made mine for my size (s/m), but will have plenty of tips on how to make it to fit you. (i am a typical size small and made mine a tad oversized.)\r\n\r\n*this pattern follows us crochet terms.\r\n\r\n*turning ch 3 does not count as a stitch.\r\n\r\n*number of stitches indicated between “<>“."
