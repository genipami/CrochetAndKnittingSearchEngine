  "notes": "there are so many reasons to love the bobble pocket prayer square pattern. this hand-held prayer square gives you something to hold while praying and the cross itself is a beautiful texture that is soothing to hold.\r\n\r\nmake a bunch and toss one in your purse, car, and keep at your bedside table. you can make these with all of that scrap yarn you've been holding onto. \r\n\r\nthey are fast to make and you can whip up a square in about 15-minutes, which is great when you're looking for a break from prayer shawls and other longer projects.\r\n\r\nthese are also perfect for little kids learning to pray too as they're just their size and pretty indestructible. \r\n\r\nthis pattern is also available for free on my blog. the premium pdf also includes a tutorial for the double crochet bobble stitches and a chart for bobble stitch placement.\r\n\r\nthese prayer squares use mainly single crochet stitches, with bobble stitches to make the textured cross. the border is made from the reverse single crochet (aka crab stitch) to add a finishing touch.\r\n\r\ndimensions: approximately 2.75\" x 3\" (7 cm x 8 cm)\r\n\r\nmaterials needed:\r\n\r\nsize 4 worsted weight yarn, such as caron simply soft - 11-12 yards\r\nh-8 (5mm) hook\r\nscissors\r\nyarn needle\r\n\r\ngauge: not important for this pattern\r\n\r\nall of my patterns are tested by experienced pattern testers to ensure the pattern is easy to follow. they are professionally edited to minimize errors and ensure the wording is consistent with industry standards, making it easy for you to read.\r\n\r\nbecome a remington lane crochet vip:\r\nsubscribe to our newsletter to get 10% off your order today.
