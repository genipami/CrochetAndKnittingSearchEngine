    "content": "this evanesce shawl demonstrates how it s possible to get a fade effect with just a single solid color of yarn it does this by gradually decreasing the amount of positive space used as the shawl progresses in other words it fades from solid to lace as you work each row the shawl is constructed of end-less continuously-worked hexagon motifs so there s no sewing and no yarn tails the hexagons are arranged to give the shawl a trapezoid shape video tutorial on youtube 1 the yarn specified might be hard to find but any fingering weight cotton or cotton/bamboo blend will work very well solid colors only are recommended because variegated or color-changing yarns will distract from the visual texture/fade effect 1 https //youtu be/hlvlc4s7myo si=ejpp8wa-kig7oecj"
