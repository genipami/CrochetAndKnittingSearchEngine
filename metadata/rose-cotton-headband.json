  "notes": "the rose cotton headband is knitted flat with a delicate romantic lace pattern as the centerpiece and two i-cords bands at each end for easy fastening around the head. \r\n\r\nit is a great stash buster as it uses relatively little yarn (less than half of the skein). the pattern comes in one size - but depending on how many rows the lace repeat and i-cord bands are knitted it can be adjusted to be either longer or shorter.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is free and includes both a charted instruction for the lace repeats as well as written instructions - so that you can choose what fits you the best.\r\n\r\ni hope you will enjoy this little project!",
