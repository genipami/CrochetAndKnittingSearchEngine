    "content": "these mitts are a project i came up with to donate to the treasure box in my child s second grade class and to other local charities i live in a warm climate so full mittens are impractical most of the time but every child i know seems to go bonkers over fingerless mitts these mitts will fit a 4-7 year old child but are easily altered"
