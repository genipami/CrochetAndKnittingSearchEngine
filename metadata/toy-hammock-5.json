  "notes": "tired of all your kids' stuffies on the floor? put them up! this hammock fits right in the corner of a wall and holds a lot of stuffies and toys. i have one for each of my kids and it's great. you can put it lower so they can reach, or if you're like me, up high so they stay where they are until they want one down to play with. this pattern is crazy easy to make and works up nice and fast. you can use virtually any kind of yarn, so it's great for using up scraps. enjoy!",
