    "content": "this little bootee is made with the old-fashioned daisy stitch it is not at all lacy so is just as suitable for little boys as little girls the instep makes an ideal canvas for little cross stitch designs or any other sort of embroidery you might like to add to personalise them i particularly like bullion roses if you want to make these in advance but you don t know whether the baby will be a boy or girl why not make them in white and then do the tie and trims in another colour once baby arrives remember you can put a trim around the sole too my shell bootee pattern explains how pattern available both in british and american crochet terms"
