  "notes": "this is just another take on grandmother's favorite dishcloth. there are a few changes i've made to accommodate my ocd need for symmetry. each dishcloth takes roughly 1oz. of yarn, as written. i hope you like it!\r\n\r\n**update 03/23/22**\r\ni added new photos *(the ones on this pattern page)* to the written pattern, and also was able to add a spanish translation! thank you rosemary kiladitis for doing the work to translate my words beautifully!"
