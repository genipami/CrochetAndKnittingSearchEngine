  "notes": "this mitten pattern requires an entire ball of álafosslopi to complete. i had approximately 5 meters lefts over from one pair of mittens. if your gauge is different than mine or if you don’t enjoy playing yarn chicken, it would be best to either buy an additional ball of yarn or knit the cuffs in an alternate color. this is noted in the pattern details.
