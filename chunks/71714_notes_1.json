    "content": "gauge is not important on this handy market bag as written this uses every bit of one skein of euroflax linen if you have extra yarn in your stash you may choose to finish it off with a single_crochet edging around the handles and top of bag the linen makes this bag really sturdy but any kitchen cotton can be substituted for something like peaches n cream i recommend a 6 0mm hook j this will make a slightly larger bag you will need 2 balls of peaches or sugar and creme to make this bag"
