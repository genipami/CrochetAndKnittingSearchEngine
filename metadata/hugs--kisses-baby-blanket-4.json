  "notes": "** **i have created a facebook group for lovers of the hugs & kisses collection.  please join me at [crochet hugs & kisses blanket][1] and just answer a couple questions.** **\r\n\r\na brand new granddaughter is arriving soon, so that means a brand new baby blanket in honor of her.  this crochet project features a series of cross stitches and bobbles, or x’s & o’s, so that is how this became the hugs & kisses baby blanket.\r\n\r\ni used the new caron baby cakes in dreamy rose for this, but feel free to substitute regular caron cakes or any worsted weight yarn of your choice.\r\n\r\nthe stitches all come from the [stitch is right wave game][2] that we played here on [the crochet crowd][3] back in 2016.  i choose 4 of the 8 stitches we learned in pattern to create this blanket.  all the video tutorials of each stitch are below to help you.  you can easily adapt this chevron blanket to any size you’d prefer.  the finished size is 36? x 40?.\r\n\r\n*update 5/20/2020*\r\nthe pattern now includes a diagram!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.facebook.com/groups/crochethugskissesblanket/\r\n  [2]: http://thecrochetcrowd.com/the-stitch-is-right-wave-game-for-crocheters/\r\n  [3]: http://thecrochetcrowd.com/"
