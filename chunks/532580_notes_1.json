    "content": "the blend of cables and ribs make this an attractive unisex hat that is relatively quick to make using smaller needles make for a dense knit to keep your head warm this winter there are two sizes to choose from and two different brim options single and folded brim because of the ribbing this hat is very stretchy and forgiving so you don t need to worry too much about the stitch gauge the row count however is important to achieve the right length for your hat if need be you can make adjustments by changing needle size and/or ribbing length on the bottom gauge 22 sts and 28 rounds in 2 x 2 ribbing i suggest a heavier worsted/aran rather than a light worsted for better results"
