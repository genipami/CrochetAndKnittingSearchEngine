  "notes": "there’s loads of wonderful sock patterns out there but i really wanted to record a formula for socks that can be used for pretty much any yarn/hook combination.  i also wanted the socks to have short-row heels because they’re neat and simple.  finally, i wanted the socks to be worked in extended single crochet because it’s thin, and smooth and stretchy (for crochet).  \r\n\r\nhence, the quokka socks pattern.  i named them for the cute little marsupials that only live here in western australia - famously on a small island off the coast where roger federer took a selfie with some of them last year.\r\n\r\ni have made these socks in yarns ranging in weight from the sock weight ’not just socks' with a 2.5mm hook at a gauge of 7 stitches per inch (spi) up to the bulky weight ‘denim effects’ with a 5.5mm hook at a gauge of 3.3 stitches per inch .  you can, however, use the pattern with almost any yarn/hook combination with a little bit of maths. \r\n \r\nmy calculations/workings for the sock weight yarn are shown throughout the pattern.  see my project notes for details of other yarn/hook/size combinations.\r\n\r\nthanks heaps to my lovely testers melissa, christine and valda for their effort and feedback.  much appreciated.\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy making these socks.  please contact me if you have any questions - i'm happy to help.\r\n\r\nsusan",
