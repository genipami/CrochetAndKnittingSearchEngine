    "content": "**construction** flower girls are knit in one piece from the bottom-up the doll s body can be knit flat on straight needles and seamed or knit in the round on dpns after knitting the skirt is worked from stitches picked up around the doll s waist and embellished with hand embroidery stitches simple sewing techniques are used to define the arms and legs after knitting **gauge** exact gauge is not important i recommend choosing a needle 2 or 3 sizes smaller than recommended on the ball band to create a dense fabric that will keep the stuffing hidden"
