    "content": "the sweater is knit from the top down starting with the hood followed by neck raglan increase body and finally sleeves and finishing the body of the sweater is a simple garter stitch followed by a stockinette stitch pattern you can add extra personality to the sweater by finishing it off with some super cute buttons size should fit 9-12 mo baby i used 2 skeins of i love this cotton yarn in dove but you could also use a soft wool yarn of similar weight for a warmer sweater i used us7 needles to knit the majority of the pattern and switched to us5 size for ribbing on the bottom of the sweater and cuff of the sleeves i ve also tried it using us7 for the whole thing and that turns out fine too"
