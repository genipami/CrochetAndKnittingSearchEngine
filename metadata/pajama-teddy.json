  "notes": "crochet these adorably cozy teddy bears wearing pajamas! they are perfect for cuddling using a delightfully soft yarn! \r\n\r\nfind the free pattern on my blog ***[here][1]***!\r\n\r\nyou will need approximately 3 skeins of \"feels like bliss\" yarn (bulky level 5): 2 skeins of the main color (teddy color) and one skein of the contrast color (pajama color) with a 5 mm hook.  the colors \"cocoa\" and \"sky\" were used for the brown teddy with blue pajamas while the colors \"optic white\" and \"blush\" were used for the white teddy with pink pajamas. \r\n\r\ntwo different body sizes for the bear (body 1 is the smaller pink pajamas and body 2 is the larger blue pajamas) are included in the written pattern. the fuzzy yarn \"feels like bliss\" blurs the stitches and gives a lovely glow to your stuffed animals.  \r\n\r\nplease note that this pattern is not recommended for complete beginners as some crochet, amigurumi and working in the round experience would be beneficial (it is challenging to see individual stitches when working with this yarn as you need to feel for the next stitch.  tips for working with fluffy yarn are included in the pattern, and the skill level for this design is level 3 intermediate.\r\n\r\nif you are interested in other fluffy teddy bears, be sure to check out my [fleece teddy & bunny][2] using jumbo level 7 yarn!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.allaboutami.com/pattern-pajama-teddy/\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/fleece-teddy--bunny"
