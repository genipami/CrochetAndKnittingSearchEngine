  "notes": "this has always been my most requested hat pattern. \r\n\r\neasy to crochet and sized to fit based on math this hat is perfect for multiple sizes and provides instructions for both mid-ear and base of earlobe lengths.\r\n\r\nyarn: red heart with love\r\nhook: 5.50 mm (i)\r\ngauge: 3 sts per inch / 2.75 rounds per inch\r\n\r\ni have had numerous requests for beanies using different yarn and hook combinations.  \r\n\r\nthe first request is for a half double crochet beanie using worsted weight yarn (specifically red heart with love) with a 5.50 mm crochet hook. \r\n\r\nthe instructions below are for a mid-ear length beanie using this specific yarn and hook combination.  \r\n\r\nif you want this beanie to reach the base of your earlobe instead - the information you need to increase the length is included at the very end of the post.\r\n\r\nhave fun with your yarn!\r\nrhondda"
