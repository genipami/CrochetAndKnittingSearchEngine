    "content": "we re familiar with where the yarn goes when we make that magic loop turn but with short row you ll necessarily be doing some purls after that magic loop turn this can get confusing if you over-think it basically this is the idea - you want your yarn to be in the front of your needle if the next stitch is a purl or in the back if your next stitch is a knit it s really that simple pattern directions cast on and lip preparation using lip color yarn and # 7 needle 16 length cast on 88 stitches place a distinctive bor marker and join in the round knit until piece is about 1 5 long it should curl over as you work securing the lips i wanted to completely control how far the lips turned over sometimes they were rolling over so far that you could see the ugly join on the back side where the lip and mouth colors joined i tried just doing a round of purl stitches before doing the mouth and that helped but i ended up liking one of the 2 methods below the first method is by far the easiest and looks basically like the second method however the first method creates a hat opening that is a little bit tighter so although the second method is much more fiddly i prefer it because the hat opening is still nice and stretchy but both look about the same securing the lips - method #1 work a purl round to sew down later - much easier to do but not quite as stretchy an opening knit as directed until piece is about 1 50 long work a round of purl still using lip color cut a long tail you ll be using this later to sew all of those purl stitches to the curled lip join mouth color and begin working as directed below later i typically wait until i m almost done take that long tail and do the following 1 let the stockinette from the cast on edge roll up to a natural position 2 take the long tail you cut and thread it onto a tapestry needle 3 sew together a purl stitch you knit to a stitch from the rolled up stockinette do this gently - you don t want it tight 4 secure and weave in the ends since the lips will show make sure to weave in ends out of sight inside the fish hat #43 fish adult size v1 2 securing the lips - method #2 note if you are using an earlier version of this pattern i ve reworked this a little to make it easier working 2 rounds together - more difficult but creates a stretchier fish/hat opening 1 knit as directed until piece is about 1 5 long 2 let the stockinette brim roll over to what seems like a natural position what you are going to do now is work"
