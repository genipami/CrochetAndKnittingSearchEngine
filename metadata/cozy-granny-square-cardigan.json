  "notes": "materials\r\n\r\nmedium weight (4) yarn – i used colors; ecru, honey, adobe, olive, pomegranate, mahogany. (i really enjoyed working with this yarn, i have already bought more and have future pattern planned with it!)\r\nnumber of skeins needed: these are 100g skeins of yarn and i used a total of 6 different colors (as shown below, you will need an extra skein of yarn of the color you chose for your ribbing).\r\nxs/s you need 1 skein of each color, and 2 skeins for the color you use for the ribbing.\r\nm/l & xl/2xl you need 2 skeins of each color, and 3 skeins for the color you use for the ribbing.\r\n3xl/4xl you need 3 skeins of each color, and 4 skeins for the color you use for the ribbing.\r\n\r\n5.00mm crochet hook\r\n\r\nscissors\r\n\r\ndarning needle\r\n\r\nbuttons – i linked some similar ones, but i can’t link the ones i used, because i used mismatched 19mm buttons i had laying around in my craft stash. you can really use whatever button style/size you’d like (i think some wooden buttons would look lovely)!\r\n\r\npattern notes\r\n\r\n*cardigan is meant to be a boxy, slightly oversized with crop fit, if you do not like that, maybe consider sizing down.\r\n\r\n*this pattern follows size xs/s, but has sizes xs-4xl\r\n\r\n*this pattern uses us crochet terms.\r\n\r\n*turning ch 3 does count as a dc stitch in this pattern.\r\nturning ch 1 does not count as a sc stitch\r\n\r\n*when making the granny squares, you will be work in ch spaces and not in stitches.\r\n\r\n*for every size you will need 27 panel squares and 8 sleeve squares."
