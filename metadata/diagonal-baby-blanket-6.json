  "notes": "this blanket is my go-to quick knit. with its super simple corner to corner method, and only 3 types of stitch used, its a great project to work up when you're in want of a nice mindless knit, and with its buit in edge, and soft garter stitch pattern, the finished product is beautifully modern in its simplicity."
