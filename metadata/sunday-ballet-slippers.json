  "notes": "this slippers pattern starts at the toe working in rounds, then in rows until desired length is reached, then around the top to cinch things up! \r\n\r\n**pattern notes:**\r\n\r\nplace first stitch of each row in the same stitch as your chain.\r\n\r\nch-2 at beginning of round does not count as a stitch.\r\n\r\npattern written in us terms.\r\n\r\ninstead of using the magic circle you could also chain-4, join to first chain to form a circle."
