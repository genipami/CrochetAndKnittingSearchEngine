  "notes": "pattern pdf on the archive at the main link is in english.\r\n\r\n[pattern in norwegian][1]\r\n\r\n[pattern in german][2]\r\n\r\n[pattern in swedish][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n**please note, as of 7/23/2020, this pattern is no longer available on ravelry.** when ravelry redesigned their website in june 2020, their new design immediately created accessibility issues for people. the redesign has caused migraines in some users after just a short exposure to the site, and for others, it has triggered seizures. the response from ravelry over the past month has been incredibly defensive, with no assurances that the site will get fixed, or providing any information on how they plan to go forward. as such, i cannot in good conscious offer my patterns on ravelry any longer. i do not have an alternative site set up, and i do not know when i will get to it. **if you want to knit one of my patterns, do not ask me to send it to you - instead, i ask you send the powers that be at ravelry a message asking them to honor the inclusiveness that they have called for for bipoc and lgbtqia+ folx and fix their site so it is accessible for everyone.**\r\n\r\nif you're interested in resizing the pattern please look [here][4].\r\n\r\nmultnomah county, in northwestern oregon, is home to a place very near and dear to my heart: the city of portland. while there are many reasons i love it, one thing that always stands out is how lush it is with vegetation. trees and leafy vines grow absolutely everywhere.\r\n\r\nthe idea for this shawl was conceived while i was at home, but about 2/3 of the way through knitting it my husband and i made the 6 hour drive from our house to portland. i'd been kicking several names around in my head, but nothing seemed right. then we crossed the multnomah county line. i looked at the landscape speeding by  outside my window, then down at the knitting i had in my hands, and the colors of it were the same. and right then i knew my shawl finally had a name.\r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\n\r\nyarn: 412 yards of fingering weight yarn. sample shown in sanguine gryphon bugga! in rainbow scarab\r\n\r\nneedles: size 3 / 3.25 mm circular needle, 24\"/60 cm or longer, or size needed to make gauge\r\n \r\nnotions: 4 stitch markers\r\n \r\ngauge: 24 sts and 21 garter ridges = 4” in garter st\r\n \r\nfinished size: 44 x 19\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  [2]: \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://web.archive.org/web/20141013222201/http://www.synnove.de/multnomahnorsk.pdf\r\n  [2]: https://web.archive.org/web/20160826141850/https://helloknitty.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/multnomah-german.pdf\r\n  [3]: https://web.archive.org/web/20141014105451/http://helloknitty.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/multnomah-pc3a5-svenska.pdf\r\n  [4]: http://www.ravelry.com/projects/hello-knitty/multnomah"
