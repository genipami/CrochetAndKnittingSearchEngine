  "notes": "fingering weight yarn is my favorite weight to work with, and over the past few years i have ended up with quite a collection of partial skeins. i was playing with them one day and thought that knitting a hat with two strands, slowly changing colors, would be a fun way to use some of them up.\r\n\r\nyummy 2-ply held double makes such a wonderfully squishy fabric that i was instantly hooked, and have already knit 6 of these hats! the pattern is simple, but the opportunity to play with colors is endless... pull out your bag of odds and ends, find 6 (or more, or fewer) colors you like together, and cast on!\r\n\r\n**yarn**\r\nmiss babs yummy 2-ply \r\n100% superwash merino wool; 400 yd/4 oz (365 m/115g) skeins\r\n\r\nshown in a variety of monochromatic and variegated colorways, with 6 colors used per hat.\r\n\r\nor approximately 290 (350) yards/265 (320) meters of fingering weight yarn divided amongst 6 colors: the first and last colors (used for ribbing and crown of hat) use a little more than 50 (60) yards/45 (55) meters each, the middle colors a little less.\r\n",
