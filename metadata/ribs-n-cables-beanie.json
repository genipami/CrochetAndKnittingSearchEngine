  "notes": "the blend of cables and ribs make this an attractive, unisex hat that is relatively quick to make.\r\nusing smaller needles make for a dense knit to keep your head warm this winter.\r\nthere are two sizes to choose from and two different brim options, single and folded brim.\r\nbecause of the ribbing this hat is very stretchy and forgiving, so you don't need to worry too much about the stitch gauge. the row count, however, is important to achieve the right length for your hat. if need be, you can make adjustments by changing needle size and/or ribbing length on the bottom.\r\ngauge: 22 sts and 28 rounds in 2 x 2 ribbing.\r\ni suggest a heavier worsted/aran rather than a light worsted for better results.",
