    "content": "transmutation in alchemy is the conversion of base metals into gold or silver more generally it is used to describe a change to a higher form - for example leftover sock yarns turning into a pretty pair of scrappy socks these socks are worked from the cuff down with a reinforced heel flap and triangular gusset under the sole the stranded pattern is a 6-stitch repeat so naturally all floats are short 5 stitches or fewer you can use as few or as many colours as you want if you use only two colours it should be possible to carry the unused yarn to prevent having extra ends to weave in otherwise i highly recommend looking into some weaving in ends as you go methods my preferred method is to hold the end in my other hand and catch it on every other stitch at least 5 times like catching a float in stranded colourwork when joining a new colour i pre-weave the starting end in the previous round there are 5 sizes xs s m l xl with 60 66 72 78 84 stitches per round the sample socks are shown in size s the stranded pattern is charted only you may use any technique you prefer for knitting a small circumference in the round you are free to sell anything you make using this pattern but please do not sell the pattern itself or otherwise claim it as your own"
