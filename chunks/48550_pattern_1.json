    "content": "filet crochet pumpkin ~ my own design i used bright orange senso size 3 #1 steel crochet hook finishing at about 12 x 8 1/2 *i m guessing that #10 thread would be about 7 x 4 and ww yarn=placemat size chain 80 double_crochet in 4th st from hook there should be 77 double_crochet in first row work from the bottom up filet crochet charts should be read alternating row reading from right to left the next row up from left to right this is a symmetrical pattern so if you mess up and forget to switch directions sometimes it won t matter but i would suggest practicing the correct way because it is really hard to break a bad habit you have practiced tip you should count how many blocks you have to fill before the next space if you have 11 blocks to fill that is 11x3=33+1=34dc between the spaces you multiply x 3 because the blocks share walls and you only have 1 wall that has to be counted extra this prevents you missing a double_crochet and grief later this design is 25 blocks x 25 blocks filet works out wider than longer as you can see when you compare my pattern to the finished piece i had no graph paper and just lined a piece of note paper it s messy but i think you can read it you ll see where i counted my blocks to the next open space for the pumpkin noted on the side the stem look at the large pic of the finished mat below and study the stem i wanted the stem to taper so instead of the block having 4dc it only has 3 so you must add 1ch stitch to take it s place when you are on the next row above it you ll find there is no double_crochet post to crochet into because of the missing double_crochet i crocheted into that extra chain you can see that on the large pic below the graph don t forget the top solid row my paper ran out and it s hard to tell it s up there the graph looks taller than the graph because filet blocks are not square it will look like the finished pic copyright sept 30 2006 ~ do print for yourself or friends with no computer enjoy make as a group sell the finished work but not the pattern don t copy to your site nor copy and send in email send them the link not the pattern don t sell nor send the graph or pic of mat to a magazine do not remove my id/copyright info from it when printing ~cozy"
