  "notes": "antonio’s autumn cloche is the third hat in ***the four seasons*** collection.\r\n\r\nit is widely believed that antonio vivaldi’s inspiration for the four seasons stems from the time he spent as the court chapel master in the gorgeous countryside of mantua, italy.\r\n\r\nthis is autumn.\r\nlike its companion, *vivaldi autumn mitts*, this cloche brings to mind vibrant leaves turned ocher, sienna, burgundy, crimson, and gold. a sense of quiet as they flutter and fall, and the earth settles into a season of stillness.\r\n\r\nthe lace pattern is rhythmic and easy to memorize and is both written and charted. \r\n\r\nthis cloche is sized to fit an average teen/adult head 20-24 inches/50-60cm.\r\n\r\nantonio’s autumn cloche has been test knit.\r\n\r\nin lieu of paying a fee for this pattern, please consider making a donation to **world central kitchen**. since 2010, world central kitchen has been providing meals to communities affected by conflict, natural disasters, and climate crisis all over the world. **https://wck.org**",
