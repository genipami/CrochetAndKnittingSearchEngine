  "notes": "collab with courtney shepherd aka [@gothfaeriescreations][1]\r\nget her matching bunny lovey [here][2]\r\n\r\nthis blanket is a variation on the classic 6-day kid blanket (6dkb). it was inspired by beautiful viral photos of 6-day kid blankets.\r\n\r\nthe original classic 6-day kid blanket was written for a toddler-sized blanket made with chunky weight yarn, and can easily be made in six days. \r\n\r\nif you wanted to make a different size blanket or use different yarn, you would have to take my original pattern and make alterations. \r\n\r\nthis pattern gives exact instructions for a baby blanket made with dk weight yarn with the look and color choices you have all been asking me for.\r\n\r\ni’ve added my own special details - a straight start and squared off edge for a clean look, symmetrical stripes, and a camel stitch border with a simple but elegant edge.\r\n\r\n[please visit my website if you would like to purchase this pattern with graphs.][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.instagram.com/gothfaeriescreations\r\n  [2]: https://www.etsy.com/listing/1035451679/bunny-lovey-crochet-pattern-pdf-download?ref=search_recently_viewed-1\r\n  [3]: https://betty-mcknit.myshopify.com/products/copy-of-6-day-kid-blanket-viral-variation-with-graphs"
