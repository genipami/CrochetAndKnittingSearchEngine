    "content": "**about this pattern** a quick easy cowl that is narrow and sits close to the neck for maximum warmth it s not bulky and is perfect for wearing under hoodies coats or jackets i ve used a simple but fun drop-stitch motif that is repeated in the round to create a reversible fabric **skills needed** you need to be able to cast on bind off knit purl and knit in the round **sizing** there is one adult size but this can be customised by increasing/decreasing co stitches by 8 and increasing/decreasing the length of the buff my buff measures 11 in length and has a circumference of 19 after blocking **gauge** 20 stitches over 40 row in ribbing = 4 important i am a very tight knitter so if you just knit this without checking gauge you are likely to get a larger finished object than me and require more yarn my advice is to knit a quick gauge swatch to ensure the correct fit **yarn** 8ply/dk or 4ply/fingering weight yarn held double i used 1 skein of great southern yarn dk 50% merino/ 50% alpaca in the rosalie gascoigne colour i used approx 70g of wool for this **needles** 4mm 16 circulars i used the small 4 length needles so that i could knit in the round comfortably as mentioned above i am a tight knitter so you may need to use a smaller sized needle to achieve the same fit/gauge **support and feedback** i ve tried very hard to ensure this pattern is error-free but i welcome any feedback if something doesn t look right or doesn t make sense you can contact me with any feedback or questions on email knittedbyjacquiverbeek@gmail com please note that i am located in australia so there might be a delay in responding due to the time difference"
