  "notes": "*the so comfy socks pattern is for a basic, everyday pair of socks with a great fit.\r\nperfect if you want to knit something truly comfortable — for yourself or someone you love.\r\nthe kind of project you’ll want to knit more than once. because comfort is always a good idea.*\r\n\r\n**pattern details**\r\n\r\nthe pattern is written for four different stitch counts to accommodate a range of sizes and preferences:\r\n60, 66, 72, and 78 stitches (measured at the leg circumference).\r\n\r\nyou’ll find clear step-by-step instructions and links to seven video tutorials showing each stage of the knitting process — from the cast-on to the final grafting. all videos are short and focused, so you can knit with confidence even if it’s your first time making socks.\r\n\r\nno fixed gauge is required — simply choose the stitch count that suits your yarn and knitting tension best. the pattern includes charts and color-coded instructions for easy navigation.\r\n\r\n**available formats**\r\n\r\nyou’ll receive two pdf files:\r\n\r\nso comfy socks screen – best for viewing on your device\r\n\r\nso comfy socks print – ink-friendly with a white background, but all charts and graphics are just like in the screen version.\r\n\r\n**foot length**\r\n\r\nadjustable — knit to your preferred size.\r\n\r\n**gauge**\r\n\r\nnot fixed. the sample shown is worked with 40 stitches and 58 rounds = 10 cm in stockinette, in the round, using 2.0 mm needles (after blocking).\r\n\r\n**needles**\r\n\r\n2.0/2.25 mm circular needles or size needed to achieve your preferred fabric.\r\nyou can use double-pointed needles if you prefer, but you’ll need to arrange the stitches yourself — the pattern doesn’t include instructions for dpns.\r\n\r\n**yarn**\r\n\r\nany fingering weight sock yarn\r\n(approx. 400–420 m / 100 g).\r\n\r\n**difficulty**\r\n\r\nbeginner-friendly but not boring — ideal for learning sock construction or enjoying a mindful, rhythmic knit.\r\n\r\n**techniques**\r\n\r\nstretchy cast-on, working in the round, 2x1 and 5x1 ribbing, reinforced heel, gusset shaping, wedge toe, and kitchener stitch."
