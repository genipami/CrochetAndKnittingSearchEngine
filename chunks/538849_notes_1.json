    "content": "a companion to the toasty texters ribbed pattern this fingerless mitt has a snug-fitting plain wrist and a fully-gussetted thumb no frills and very simple this pattern is sure to please anyone who wants a mitt pattern that will let the yarn do the talking this is also an ideal pattern for someone new to mitten-knitting since it does not contain any additional patterning such as cables or lace the samples were knit using a heavier-dk and a lighter dk weight yarn and both pairs came out the right size the pattern employs a slight negative ease ensuring a perfect fit without the mitts being too tight"
