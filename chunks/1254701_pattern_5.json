    "content": "ok bearing in mind that it will start a little below the shoulder when the cardigan is sewn up and a cuff will be added to the end back panel width check that with a small amount of pressure to mimic the weight of the finished cardigan that the panel reaches at least shoulder tip to shoulder tip with up to an inch or two on each side front panel width check that the panel reaches from the centre of the underarm to within an inch of the centre of the chest front panel length check that the panel is the desired length with a small amount of pressure to mimic the weight of the finished cardigan and allowing for a small border same width as the button band hood height drape the row over your head and check that it easily reaches the shoulders add or remove squares from each dimension as required for the desired fit once you are happy with each dimension recalculate the number of squares required and keep crocheting until you have enough step 6 joining the squares it is not critical which method is used to join the squares there are many tutorials available in youtube so take your pick because there should be the same number of stitches on each side of each square the stitches should line up on a one-to-one basis making the joins nicely even because i was using a colour changing yarn i realised that it wasn t going to be possible to hide the joins so i went for a single_crochet us terminology - double_crochet uk terminology join on the outside for each stitch insert the hook through corresponding edge stitches of each square draw up a loop and then complete the stitch when joining over a previous seam chain one and then continue to the next stitch as normal one of the benefits of this method is that you can crochet over the ends left from the squares as you go which saves a lot of work later page 8 recipe for a granny square cardigan by insertinnergeek designs step 7 joining the panels i suggest creating each panel separately before joining the panels together i used the same technique for seaming the panels as i did for joining the squares within the panels for each sleeve join the squares into a panel then seam each side together to create the tube if the sleeve circumference has an even number of squares then attach the end of the tube with half the squares joined to the back panel and half to a front panel if the sleeve circumference has an odd number of squares there will be a half squares which you can either position at the top so that the sleeve will have a square down the outside or at the bottom so the joins all line up with the front and back panels below the sleeves the front and back panels are seamed together join"
