    "content": "this hat is a great way to use up those little leftover balls of yarn in your stash i have designed the pattern for preemie and newborn sizes gauge is not critical for this pattern because the hat is very stretchy and will accommodate a wide range of head sizes each hat should use less than 30g of yarn i like to add a small pompom to the top to make it extra cute there are many places that take donations of preemie and baby hats a good place to start would be checking with your local nicu to see what kind of requirements they have for materials some places will only accept washable items some will take any kind of hat while some will only take acrylic hats etc"
