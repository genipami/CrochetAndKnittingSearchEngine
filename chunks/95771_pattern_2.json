    "content": "except make 2 single_crochet in the first and last stitches in each row when the length of outer edges of the triangle match the length of the corresponding edges of your square in the last row make 3 single_crochet in the very last stitch rather than 2 and continue on with single_crochet across the top edge of the triangle chain two turn and make 4 double_crochet in the first stitch from the hook *skip one stitch and make a single_crochet in the next stitch skip one stitch and make 5 double_crochet in the next stitch * repeat from * across top of triangle and fasten_off you may have to adjust your spacing at the end of the row a bit on the scallops depending on how many total stitches you ended up with just fudge it so it looks fairly even join the triangle to the square two of the edges of the square piece will look neatly finished the other two edges will look a bit less so match these unfinished-looking edges of the square up with the outer edges of the triangle and join them with single_crochet stitches making sure the crochet hook goes through both edges of the fabric again making three single_crochet in the point forming the pouch at the corner where the triangle stops start the scalloped edging as you did on the top flat edge of the triangle being careful to make extra double_crochet stitches in the top point so it flows around the point neatly making 10 double_crochet works fine and continuing down to the other corner where the pouch begins again you can continue the scallops all the way around the outside bottom edge of the pouch if you wish or stop at the corner where the pouch is attached fasten_off weave in ends make a tie make a crochet chain tie or use a ribbon about 18\u2033 long for a 10-11\u2033 square wrap longer for larger wraps and thread it through one corner of the pocket the tie will wrap around the back of the pouch and close in the front this pattern was developed for charity use and may be used freely by any and all for any purpose if you make one for your own personal use please consider making another for charity if you do copy or repost this pattern please keep my name attached as original designer debbie cowherd debbie@pobox com"
