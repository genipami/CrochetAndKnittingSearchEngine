  "notes": "i designed this vibrant, textured square for the october 2025 bam cal hosted on ravelry. \r\n\r\nthis square is inspired and named after grandma tala. i hope it brings you joy and warmth on a cozy autumn night. \r\n\r\ni have written the pattern using 5 colours, but you could adapt as you wish and create in any colour combination.\r\n\r\nin dk yarn (yarnsmiths create dk - 100% acrylic) and 4mm hook the square measures 10” when blocked. \r\ni made another with yarnsmiths merino dk yarn (slightly finer) and a 3.5mm hook which measured 8”.\r\nhand dyed sock yarn & 3mm hook, measured just over 6”.\r\n"
