    "content": "tiny star single round stars that are quick and easy to work up and have a true star shape the final size depends on the yarn you use but they are all only a couple of centimetres in size simply use any yarn you like and an appropriate hook and have a play i designed these tiny stars ages ago and forgot about them until recently when i was hunting through my supplies and came across them it took a bit of trial and error to get a nice star shape with only one round but i think these are the clear winner"
