    "content": "this is the women s version of my modified army gloves 1 pattern which is a modification of the gloves for service men pattern by the american red cross - please note that the yarn called for in this pattern is worsted weight which is usually knit with 4 5 - 5 mm needles however the gloves are knit with 3 mm needles this is meant to be so it will result in a tight fabric providing for warm and cozy gloves - about gauge i measured the gauge for 10 cm 21 sts i realised if you measure in inches you will need *22 sts* to 4 inches if your feel your gloves will turn out too small try one of these options - go up 1 needle size to get a slightly larger gauge the instructions for the length of palm and fingers should be fine as is - use the men s pattern for stitch numbers while relying on the women s pattern for length as the men s pattern actually only has 4 more stitches in width 1 http //www ravelry com/patterns/library/modified-army-gloves"
