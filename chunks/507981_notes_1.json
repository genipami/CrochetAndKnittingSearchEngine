    "content": "these socks use a chevron pattern divided by horizontal welts of garter stitch often known as welting fantastic the pattern creates ripples that will showcase a self-striping yarn with wide 5-8 row regular stripes but will also be striking with a non-regular striping solid or tonal yarn the ripples remind me of rolling hills or mountains in the distance so as i was driving through the berkshire mountains in western massachusetts that seemed a perfect name there are two sizes available - medium 66 sts and large 78 sts the pattern is a great introduction to relatively simple chart knitting and it uses only knits purls increases and decreases to create the patterning this pattern is offered for free but if you would like to buy me a cup of coffee 1 it would be greatly appreciated **follow knittymelissa ** <small>ravelry knittymelissa designs /groups/knittymelissa-designs youtube https //www youtube com/knittymelissa</small> <small>instagram @knittymelissa</small> 1 https //paypal me/knittymelissa country x=us&locale x=en_us"
