    "content": "this triangular shawl is worked from the bottom up and has built in borders i like working triangular shawls from the bottom up because i m just not keen on chaining a mile then decreasing down to the tip with its possibility of running out of yarn i also prefer not to add borders on afterwards if possible so that when you re done you re really done i really like this easy pineapple stitch and used it to make the pineapple grocery bag a free pattern in my ravelry store it s easy to execute and memorize and creates a lovely light and airy fabric i ve made sure that all of the chains in the main body are the same length 4 and that only the chain arches just before the side borders as well as those forming part of the actual pineapple motif are shorter 3 the pineapple motifs are 6 row high and are nested as is usual so that you start a new pineapple on each side every 3 row the shawl looks great in yarn weights from lace to bulky just chose a hook that gives you the fabric you like - small enough to give you good stitch definition but large enough for a soft fabric the 3 versions shown here are green - bella baby 4ply with 3mm hook cream - patons azalea 3ply with 3 5mm hook multi - super chunky mystery yarn with 7mm hook thanks loads to my lovely testers julie sandra and sandra for their effort and feedback much appreciated i hope you enjoy making this shawl please contact me if you have any questions - i m happy to help susan errata there s a small error in the finishing row instructions - this row starts like all other with slip_stitch into ch2 space at the centre of the shell in place of shift-slip_stitch which means the same thing"
