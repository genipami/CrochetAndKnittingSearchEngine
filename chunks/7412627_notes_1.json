    "content": "the lily jumper is the perfect jumper for warm spring / summer weather worked with a larger hook for the main body and sleeves it is airy and light whilst still keeping you a bit warm when the weather is on the slightly chillier side and i can confirm that it makes an excellent wear to a night out for cocktails this pattern has only been written in a medium as i made it for me changing the sizing should be relatively easy just add more row with v stitches on the yoke and the rest should increase in size naturally you may need to add more row to the sleeves if you do make it in a smaller or larger size and would like to contribute your sizing to the pattern please contact lilyindia@outlook com and i d be more than happy to add your sixing credited to the pattern for others to use"
