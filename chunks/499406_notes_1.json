    "content": "use of a variegated yarn a yarn with a combination of mixed colors for this pattern results in a confetti-like multicolored cloth the pattern will distribute the colors throughout the cloth preventing pooling of color which often has a splotchy appearance if you like working with colors you can alternate three solid colors while following the pattern this will be a little more work since you will need to carry your yarns neatly up one side and keep track of your colors but it will also give a multicolored confetti-like appearance to the cloth the linen stitch is knit over any even number of stitches so you can adjust the pattern for size/dimensions if you prefer a larger or smaller cloth or you want to make towels if you are a tight knitter you might consider using size #8 needles to avoid a stiff and curly cloth if you knit very loosely try needle size #6 gauge doesn t matter so much with this pattern but making your stitches too loose or too tight will affect the quality of your cloth"
