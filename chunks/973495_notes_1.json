    "content": "this is a very stretchy unisex hat which sits just over the ears it takes about 50g 2oz of yarn to make you ll need more if you want to make it longer for a foldover brim or to add a pompom or other embellishment on the top **errata ** cast on 108 which is a multiple of 18 not 106 **clarification ** some are confused about the no stitch notation this is standard terminology for charts and it means you ignore the square *do nothing* *pass directly to the next square* the square is only there to align the chart to make it look more like your knitting hope this helps"
