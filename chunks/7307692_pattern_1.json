    "content": "perfect stocking cap by celia llopis-jepsen what this pattern makes this makes a stretchy ribbed hat that measures 11 5 inches long with a circumference of 17 5 inches unstretched it s perfect for a medium to large adult head 21 to 23 5 circumference and long enough to fold for a 2 5 wide brim to keep your ears toasty suggested needle size us 3 or us 4 gauge 29 stitches by 33 row per 4 inches unstretched after washing yarn carry two strands of a fingering/sock yarn i used malabrigo sock yarn which i find grows the first time you wash it because it is superwash merino so if you swatch you might want to wash the swatch to see if it changes much carry two strands of different color sock yarn for a hat with a mottled/marled look carry two strands of sock yarn that are of the similar or same colorway with nuances in it to create a hat with rich color depth but less contrast instructions cast on 120 stitches using the old norwegian method or another stretchy cast on-method the common long-tail cast-on is not ideal because it won t stretch enough knit 1 purl 1 for 9 75 inches for a person with a 21-22 head for someone with a 23 head knit an extra inch of length so the hat is a bit longer adjusting the circumference of this hat the circumference is quite stretchy so i found 120 stitches works well for a 21 to 23 head but you can easily increase or decrease the cast-on stitch count by multiples of 4 to change the circumference do the decreases place a marker every 30 stitches now the stitches are divided into 4 groups of 30 you will do decreases every row until you re down to 12 stitches then break the yarn and seal up the hat the reason for decreasing every row instead of doing decreases every other row is that it creates a boxier shape at the top how to decrease decrease 1 stitch on each side of each marker that means you decrease 8 stitches per row do this with a ssk to the right of each marker and a k2t to the left of it"
