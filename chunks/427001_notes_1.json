    "content": "between baby and child you have the toddler the toddler has her own needs for a good hat it has to stay just as well on the head while walking around as while taking a nap in a stroller or a pulk and it has to be warm enough where it is most needed this hat has a wide rib that makes the hat fit without beeing too tight the rib can be folded up if the hat is too big at first but it is meant to be worn down and with no part of the hat moving around during play time the ear flaps starts under the rib and gives double rib over the ears - hence the name this makes the ears always warm and the fact that the ear flaps are not in contact with the edge of the hat makes it fit without pulling around the face the hat should be knitted in good yarn that does not itch for the child preferably in colours and patterns that the child likes to avoid protests all the way until the hat is too small **edit november 2013 ** i have made a chart in the download files of one way to get the decreases in the mock cable version right the pattern starts on the first row of the mock cable pattern and repeats six times around the hat i will probably include this in a later version of the pattern if i get positive feedback"
