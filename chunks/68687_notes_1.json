    "content": "this is a very stretchy bag with a comfortable wide strap that won t dig into your shoulder when you ve got a big load of fruit or yarn or rocks the yarn is machine washable and dryable so if a tomato squishes it s no big deal the strap isn t very long which is intentional because i don t like stretched out straps that leave the bottom of the bag dangling by my knees if you want a longer strap plan on more yarn or else do fewer repeats of the mesh pattern before working the ribbing if you have any questions or comments please feel free to contact me"
