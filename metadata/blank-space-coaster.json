  "notes": "**this is a pay what you want pattern! use the code blankspace50 for 50% off the original price or use the code blankspace100 for a free copy. thank you for your support!\r\n\r\nthe blank space coaster is a perfect project for crocheters of all skill levels, combining simplicity with a touch of elegance. featuring basic stitches that work up quickly, this coaster is ideal for those looking for a relaxing, straightforward pattern. the charm lies in its lacy, decorative edge, which adds a subtle but beautiful flair to an otherwise minimalist design. whether you're making a set for your own home or crafting a thoughtful gift, the blank space coaster brings a cozy, handmade touch to any space.\r\n\r\nthis pattern is made in dk weight yarn with a 4.5mm hook. i think a synthetic or plant fiber is best for a coaster, as you will want it to be easy care. this coaster is worked in the round in double crochet stitch. you work increases every rnd to get it to the proper size and the last round adds a festive edging that is fun to make. gauge is not crucial in such a small piece.\r\n\r\nthis pattern is written for one size which should be a perfect fit for most mugs. if you find that it is too small/too large for your mug, i encourage you to experiment with another gauge or the number of rounds.\r\n\r\nthis is a beginner friendly pattern, it uses basic stitches and there are also links to video tutorials for all the special techniques.\r\n\r\nthank you for choosing my pattern. i hope you enjoyed it. you may sell as many of the finished items as you wish, but if you share on social media please give me credit @stopitharry on ravelry and link the pattern to its source. if you have any questions or need pattern support, please contact me @stopitharry on ravelry. i appreciate your support.\r\n\r\nthank you to all my amazing testers [divavonpurl](/people/divavonpurl), [yayalovestoknit](/people/yayalovestoknit), [jooleej](/people/jooleej), [coffeebuddy](/people/coffeebuddy), [lilabuczynski](/people/lilabuczynski), [yarnseed](/people/yarnseed), [crazyearscrochet](/people/crazyearscrochet), and [czerwonykapturek](/people/czerwonykapturek)! this pattern wouldn’t have been possible without you ❣️"
