    "content": "the hats for sailors hfs group here on ravelry hosts a monthly hat-along the september 2024 theme **rib fest** inspired me to try this alternative rib stitch that includes eyelets i ve used the stitch before but not all over in a hat worked in the round this hat is a good small project for an intermediate knitter to enjoy or a beginner ready for the next step in addition to basic knit and purl stitches the pattern includes simple yarn overs k2tog p2tog slip_stitch and psso pass slip_stitch over but you only have to work those stitches 1 out of every 4 rounds throughout the body of the hat while the sample hats were made using 100% superwash wool as required by hfs i m sure you have suitable yarn choices in your stash to make a special version for yourself or others i d love to see your creation i knit this hat twice just for fun and to see how the color choice changes the look hence the name **do it again ** which then naturally lead to the song choice by steely dan as with a number of my other patterns a link to the youtube video of the song is included hum along as you knit hope you ll enjoy your project remember the gift giving holidays are coming up soon and don t forget those who sigh and moan that their birthday has to be celebrated during a snow storm every year"
