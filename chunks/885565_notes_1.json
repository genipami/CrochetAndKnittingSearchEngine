    "content": "inspired by the wishy washy fishy tawashi pattern by rhonda white i ve reworked this fish to be all in garter a little bit bigger and a little bit rounder why this pattern is awesome only 18 purl stitches in total only 4 ends to weave in if you do it in 2 colors gauge doesn t matter yarn weight doesn t matter except to get the size you want cute and colorful use up those cotton dishcloth cones and scraps it s free on a size us #4 needle i got a 6 x 9 inch fish but most people will likely need more like a us #6"
