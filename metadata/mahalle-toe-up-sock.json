  "notes": "“mahalle” (ma-ha-lay) means “neighborhood” in turkish. this traditional toe up sock is perfect to fit the foot length as you knit. socks are knit in the round from the toe up on a set of dpns for the toe and heel flap. the foot, leg and rib cuff can be worked on either dpns or 9\" circular needles. \r\nthe toe uses a traditional turkish figure 8 cast on, with no seam at the edge of the toes. the foot is knit in the round, in stockinette stitch.\r\nthe heel is turned using three dpns knit flat in short rows to maintain the striping more consistently. the number of leg sts is greater than those for the foot, and either can be easily increased or decreased at the heel flap section for better fit, as desired. \r\n\r\nmaterials: 1 kit urth uneek sock75% merino, 25% nylon 2 skeins, 50g each\r\n\r\nsize: to fit us women’s shoe size: s (4-6.5), m (7-9.5), l (10-12.5)\r\ns, m, l - 7 (8, 9)”/17.75 (20.25, 22.75)cm foot length.\r\n3 (3.25, 3.5)”/ 7.5 (8.25, 9) cm at widest point on foot, each size .25”/.5 cm wider at calf. \r\ntotal length of sock about 22 (20, 18)”/ 56 (51, 45.75) cm from toe to top of cuff.\r\n\r\nneedles: us 1 / 2.25 mm 9\" circular needle, or 4-5 dpns\r\nus 0 / 2 mm 9\" circular needle or 4-5 dpns for a narrower 2x2 rib cuff if desired.\r\n\r\nerrata:\r\nturn heel section, before working row 1:\r\nset up: knit across the right hand needle stitches to get to the center (working) needle.\r\n\r\nsize 3 stitch counts corrected, pattern update 02.11.2023\r\n\r\nheel flap stitch count adjusted, 07.11.2024\r\n\r\nshort row heel flap – worked flat \r\n ...rearrange the sts so that the center 34 (38, 40, 44) top/instep sts are reserved on the circular needle,...\r\n   \r\n...heel flap, which is worked only over the remaining 30 (34, 36, 40) sole sts with 2 dpns. row 1 (rs): knit 30 (34, 36, 40), turn work....  \r\n\r\nwant to knit this sock [top down][1] ?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/mahalle-top-down-sock"
