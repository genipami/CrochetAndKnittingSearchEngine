  "notes": "**pattern or download support?** - please send a private message or personal email, as i can’t respond to comments.\r\n\r\nthis is my first scarf design, inspired by the newness of spring and the long-awaited flowers that are about to blossom into a beautiful meadow. the scarf is designed with my perendale dk yarn, which is a 100% perendale wool sourced from a wonderful farm in darwin, falkland, and spun in devon, uk. the yarn has a beautiful texture that highlights the cable pattern and is also soft enough to wear against your skin. \r\n\r\n\r\nthe pattern starts from the tip and gradually increases until the midpoint where you will then decrease towards the endpoint. the cables and simple lace design create an addictive pattern that you'll love knitting, and you will just want to knit one more row before the end of the day. it’s a short scarf, meant for throwing over your shoulders and tying just once at the front or side of your neck. instructions are given for adding repeats, which allows you to go from a small quick knit to a long cosy wrap-around shawl. it's a pattern that can be adapted to any season and i hope will become your go-to scarf for spring or winter.\r\n\r\nsizes: one size (instructions included for adding repeats)\r\n\r\nfinished measurements: \r\nlength 115 cm/45”\r\nwidth 23 cm/9”\r\n\r\nneedles: size 3.5 mm (us 4) circular needles, 80 cm/32” long or needle size to obtain gauge\r\ncable needle if not using the ‘no cable needle’ method\r\n\r\nnotions: sewing needle, cable needle\r\n\r\ngauge: 30 sts x 26 rows = 10cm/4” in cable pattern \r\n\r\nyarn: annabel williams perendale dk (dk weight, 100% wool, 245m/268 yds per 100g/3.5oz skein) 1 skein\r\n\r\nlight beige sample shown in spring jasmine\r\nlength 115cm/45”\r\nwidth 23cm/9”\r\nsample took 230m/251 yds (1 skein)\r\n\r\ntips: how to work the 3/2 lc and 3/2 rc cable without a cable needle - https://youtu.be/56f1usq5b7m\r\n\r\nthis pattern is available for free on sign up. future patterns are shared with subscribers as they are released. if you’d like access to additional patterns from my collection, they are available via a contribution through ko-fi: [https://ko-fi.com/annabelwilliamsyarn][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://ko-fi.com/annabelwilliamsyarn"
