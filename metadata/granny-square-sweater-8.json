  "notes": "this is the ultimate, stashbusting, granny square sweater!\r\n\r\ntwo granny squares have shoulder/neck shaping added and gently shaped sleeves. finished off with my favourite crochet ribbing.\r\n\r\nyou will need loads of colourful aran or worsted weight stash. it's impossible for me to tell you how much you will need for yours as it was sooooo many scraps and leftovers. but you have loads of stash, i know you do!! ;p\r\n\r\nmy finished, size three, sweater weighed 810 grams approx, which worked out as 1620 metres.\r\n\r\ni predominantly used paintbox yarns, both woolmix and worsted superwash. once is classed as aran and the other worsted. for this kind of sweater, it doesn't matter that the yardage is ever so slightly different. you can't tell in the final item.\r\n\r\ni used a 4mm hook as my tension is pretty loose for this yarn weight when combined with a granny stitch. if yours is feeling dense go up to a larger hook size. \r\n\r\nmy gauge is 8.5 rows per 10cm but i didn't worry about gauge at all in making this project. \r\n\r\ni have written an extensive blog post about how to make this sweater and put together a video tutorial showing you all the necessary steps, alongside plenty of hints and tips.\r\n\r\ni made a [fluffy black and blue version][1] too!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://zeensandroger.com/2023/04/05/blue-granny-square-sweater/"
