  "notes": "[link to us version.][1]\r\n\r\njane designed this crochet along project in association with uk based yarn company stylecraft and it launched in spring 2016, following the phenomenal success of the lily pond cal project in 2015.\r\n\r\nthe project called frida's flowers blanket is inspired by mexican folk art and the colourful dresses worn by the mexican artist frida kahlo.\r\n\r\ncreated in classique cotton in 50g balls, this blanket is a combination of 12 rich, intense shades that you will use to make jane's exquisite floral designs.\r\n\r\nthe project is aimed at those looking to improve their skills rather than complete beginners.\r\n\r\npublished in 8 fortnightly instalments over 4 months, all the patterns were available to download for free from the stylecraft web site from tuesday 5th april 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.stylecraft-yarns.co.uk/crochet-along/usa/fridas-flowers"
