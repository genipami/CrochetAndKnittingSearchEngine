  "notes": "who doesn’t love a really nice fitting ribbed hat? \r\n\r\nmy family and friends sure do and this is the pattern recipe for my favorite 3x3 ribbed hat. this hat was designed with a 2.5” folded brim. it’s a very stretchy hat and the smaller size will nicely stretch to fit up to 22” head. the fit for the smaller size on larger heads is snug so you may want to knit larger size for those larger heads! \r\nthe pattern helps to guide you along to achieve the right length and the look and fit you’re after. there’s also a couple different options for decreasing the top of the hat. you might try them both and see which one you like best! \r\n\r\ni’ve knit this hat with several combinations of yarn. i recommend a yarn weight between sport and dk. pick a needle that gauges close to 7 stitches per inch in ribbed pattern or gives you the fabric you like. \r\n\r\nthis is a free pattern and has only had limited editing and \r\ntesting. if you have questions you can reach me at galzanne@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n*enjoy ~*\r\n\r\n",
