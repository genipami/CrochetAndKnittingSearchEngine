    "content": "these socks are done with a slightly wider toe than i am known for designing the method is toe-up with a more traditional gusset and heel flap as opposed to the short row heels that i tend to favour i first published this sock pattern three years ago and since then i ve added to the pattern the numbers have not changed because they are sound i have edited some grammar forms that can make things confusing and i ve added some additional insights about various hooks i ve also included links to some of the sources for my favourite sock yarns i am not being compensated for that they are not affiliate links just in case anyone needs a starting point finally i have created a pattern support email for clients who are having problems"
