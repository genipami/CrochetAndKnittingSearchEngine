  "notes": "this classic crochet teddy bear is made with size g crochet hook using bernat softee baby cotton yarn. the bear parts are crocheted separately and then stuffed with poly-fil before being stitched together to create the final product. i chose to add a bright aqua bow to complete the look (optional), but you can customize the bow or other attire to your own liking. finished bear is about 12\" tall when standing, or shorter when seated. \r\n\r\nthe pattern is free on my blog, but if you prefer to purchase a pdf of the pattern, you can do so in my etsy shop: https://www.etsy.com/shop/knitpaintsew"
