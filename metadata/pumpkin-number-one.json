  "notes": "pumpkin number one is a project worked in the round on 2.5 mm [us 1½ / uk –] double-pointed knitting needles. it features a combination of knits and purls only, so it is a very beginner-friendly project that will help you make use of your scrap yarn. \r\n\r\nthis pattern is written for one size only, but to make a bigger pumpkin you could just use a thicker yarn and larger knitting needles (tip: just get your yarn and pick a bit smaller knitting needles size than what the yarn label suggests – this way sts would be dense enough not to let the filling stick though them) and follow the knitting instructions in the same exact way.\r\n\r\nessential skills:\r\n- cast on\r\n- knit (in the round on dpns)\r\n- purl\r\n\r\nyarn: nord by drops – 50 g [1.8 oz] = approx. 170 m [186 yds] \r\n– about 12 g [0.42 oz]\r\n\r\nnotions:\r\n- 1 stitch marker\r\n- a pair of scissors\r\n- a darning needle (a long one)\r\n- some polyester stuffing\r\n- 1 coconut shell button – 15 mm [½\"]\r\n- a sharpened piece of stick – 40 x 7 mm [1½ x ¼\"]\r\n- a hot glue gun with a glue stick\r\n\r\nthis free knitting pattern is the property of ewelina wojsz (ewelina wojsz designs) and is for personal use only. you cannot modify, sell or share this pattern. you can sell finished items handmade from this pattern, made in a limited number. \r\n\r\nmy dream is to build a friendly and supportive knitting community that celebrates both the knitting process and the finished item, therefore please share your progress on social media with **#pumpkinnumberone** and tag me with **@ewelinawojszdesigns**, so i could keep track of your knits <3 \r\n\r\nthank you for respecting me and my work! \r\n\r\n",
