    "content": "these hats were invented as part of a introductory colorwork class at stitch house dorchester in dorchester ma where they are still displayed using just two balls of yarn you can get a great variation of color this is a great first project for someone tackling stranding and tries to walk you through holding yarns in two hands picking/throwing enjoy please note really take the time to check your gauge in stranded knitting and go up a needle size if needed two-color stranded colorwork works up much tighter than regular one-color stockinette"
