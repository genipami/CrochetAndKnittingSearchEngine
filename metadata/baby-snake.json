  "notes": "baby snake is an original crochet pattern by june gilbank.\r\n\r\na small but perfectly proportioned no-sew baby snake! the narrow body makes it easy to pose in a variety of realistic positions, and you can make your snakes as long or short as you want. make a baby snake in a single colour, use a variegated yarn for easy colour patterning, or combine it with my [ultimate stripes technique][1] to make a tiny striped snake!\r\n\r\nbaby snake is designed to be a perfect miniature version of the snakes in my [temperature snake][2] and [snake collection][3] patterns (see last 2 photos for size comparison), and you can also use all the striping ideas from those patterns for your baby snakes.\r\n\r\n**yarn:** small quantity of worsted weight yarn\r\n\r\n**hook:** e us/3.5mm\r\n\r\n**size:** approx 13-15\" (33-38cm) long, but you can make yours as long as you want by adding more repeats to the body! (your gauge and yarn choice will affect the finished size slightly.)\r\n\r\n**eyes:** 6mm\r\n\r\n**please note:** the rainbow-striped baby snake pictured in the 5th-8th photos here is **not** part of the free pattern. this is a donationware pattern - the basic (single colour) snake pattern as shown in the first 4 photos here is available for free from the linked page, but if you like it please consider sending me a donation to show your appreciation, and to receive the exclusive bonus rainbow ombré pattern as part of the pattern pdf:\r\n\r\nthe pdf version (available for any size donation from the link on the pattern’s webpage), also includes exclusive bonus content that you'll only find in the pdf version:\r\n- the beautiful rainbow ombré version of the snake pattern that fades through a series of colours (a classic rainbow, or any other colour palette you want).\r\n- additional tips (instructions for managing the tiny eyes and choosing variegated yarns).\r\n- the crochet instructions for the basic pattern are all included on one printer-friendly page, so you can save paper and ink by printing only that page.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n> ***please join us*** *in the [planetjune crochet designs\r\n> group](http://www.ravelry.com/groups/planetjune-crochet-designs)\r\n> - you can get pattern support, join crochet-alongs, show off your fos,\r\n> suggest new designs, and chat. all\r\n> welcome!*\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.planetjune.com/stripes\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/temperature-snake-3\r\n  [3]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/snake-collection-2"
