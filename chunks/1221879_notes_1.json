    "content": "the pattern for these sunflowers for solidarity mittens is avialable in english and swedish the pattern is free but if you can i would like you to consider donating to an organisation like the red cross unhcr or similar i would really appreciate that the pattern will be updated with photos as soon as the mittens are knitted by me or someone else you are not allowed so sell mittens made from this pattern unless you donate the profit to an organisation like those mentioned above gifting mittens is ofcourse always ok"
