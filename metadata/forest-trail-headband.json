  "notes": "**forest trail crochet headband**\r\n\r\nthis cosy crochet headband pattern is just perfect for those in-between days when you're not sure if you'll need a hat or not. you'll be able to keep your ears warm out on the trail, but won't have to risk getting \"hat-hair\" to achieve it.\r\n\r\ni love the texture in this headband that comes from the front post double crochet stitches. (the pattern includes a short photo tutorial on where to position the fpdcs)\r\n\r\n**construction**\r\nthis crochet headband is worked from side to side. i love this method for making headbands because you can just keep adding rows until you have reached the circumference that you want. so, you pretty much eliminate any risk of the headband not fitting :-)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**join my newsletter!**\r\n========================================\r\n\r\n[subscribe to my newsletter][1] to be kept in the loop about pattern releases, freebies, sales and much more!\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://nedandmimi.com/subscribe\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n© ned & mimi 2019\r\n\r\nyou are free to use this pattern to create finished products for sale, in fact i would be honoured! \r\nif selling finished products from this pattern online, i do ask that you give credit for the pattern to ned & mimi, and link back to http://www.nedandmimi.com.\r\n\r\n*due to the nature of the pdf files sales, i cannot refund any patterns (as it is not possible to 'return' the purchase). however, i am always available via email or a message here on ravelry if you have any questions about the patterns.*\r\n\r\n*the photographs and pattern contained in this pattern are the property of ned & mimi ©. this pattern is for personal use only. no unauthorized reproduction, in whole or in part, or distribution of this pattern or content is permitted.*"
