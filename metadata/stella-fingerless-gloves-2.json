  "notes": "the stella fingerless gloves are the third pattern in the stella collection (which includes a hat and scarf). this pattern features star stitch and half double crochet. i used super soft herriot yarn by juniper moon farm, a 100% baby alpaca yarn with a slight halo. you can use any dk weight yarn you'd like and a size h crochet hook.\r\n\r\nthese gloves are sized for women's small (7\"), medium (7.5\"), and large (8\"), with measurement taken around the four finger knuckles. the gloves measure approximately 7.75\" long, though instructions are included to extend the length of the finger section if desired.\r\n\r\nthe small size is also available for free on my blog at [https://kickincrochet.com/stella-fingerless-gloves][1]. the pdf is available to purchase, or you can get the complete set of three accessories at a 20% discount compared to the individual pattern prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://kickincrochet.com/stella-fingerless-gloves"
