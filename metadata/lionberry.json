  "notes": "a little bit of loveliness to drape around your shoulders. a textured, crescent-shaped shawl that can also be bundled about the neck as a scarf.\r\n\r\ni had a bit of trouble coming up with a name for this pattern. i wanted something as unique and beautiful as the shawl itself; something that would commend its artistry - and so reflect on the first and greatest artist, god - and compliment it's golden color. i chose lionberry because the rich yellow shades reminded me of aslan's mane, as well as referencing the great lion himself; and berry because it is the fruit of my labors. i am so grateful for the god-given abilities to work with my hands; to seek out wool and flax, and rejoice in the working of them. \r\n\r\noh, and yes: i think fine, handknit shawls look great with graphic tees. \r\n\r\n**note:** i knit this project left-handed; however, the only significant difference for those knitting right-handed is that the parallelograms will slant in the opposite direction as that pictured.\r\n\r\nthanks for stopping to look at my pattern.\r\n\r\n9/17/2015 a.d.\r\ni have revised the pattern, eradicating my complex increases, and making a few other minor adjustments. it should now be a bit simpler to follow!\r\n\r\nmany thanks for all the suggestions and corrections knitters have given - i commend your patience and fortitude!\r\n\r\n2/15/17 a.d.\r\nthanks to fellow raveler trekharmonica lionberry has now been translated into dutch! thanks for making this available!\r\n\r\n5/30/17 a.d.\r\nthanks to fellow raveler silcon, lionberry is now also available in portuguese! grateful for multi-lingual people sharing their knowledge and talents!\r\n\r\n7/26/21 a.d.\r\nthanks to fellow raveler sigiblack for the german translation!\r\n\r\n8/27/22 a.d. fellow raveler pigropanda has made charts for a few different sections and graciously shared them; so for those knitters who prefer working from charts, i have added them as an additional pdf.\r\n\r\n\r\n*this pattern is for personal use only.*"
