    "content": "my project today sweet pink baby blanket pattern is a fun square that is crocheted from the middle and is just so lovely and pretty in pink if it looks familiar that is because it is a square version of my christmas trimmings afghan i actually started this one first but when michael challenged me for a holiday themed idea i knew i could turn this fun pattern into a rectangle for home decor use i do like squares for babies though as it seems nice to swaddle and cuddle them once you get crocheting on this one you will notice the repeat but the colors are opposite reflections because i only used 2 colors of red heart with love in this design this textured blanket would also look nice in a solid color or even 3 colors or more as michael always says you are the artist if you would like to continue on to make this blanket bigger queen size bed topper perhaps you can just leave off the last 2 rounds and continue the repeat pattern until the size you desire the stitch counts will grow proportionally"
