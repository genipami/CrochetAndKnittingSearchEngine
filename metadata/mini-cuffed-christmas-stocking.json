  "notes": "crocheted mini christmas stocking with cuffed folded top is 6 inches tall.\r\n\r\noption for no folded cuff is worked by chaining 8 from toe instead of 12 stitches. work decreases around heel and add crocheted scalloped trim in contrasting yarn at the top.\r\n\r\nanother option is to chain 8 instead of 12 and add 4-5 rows of sc around the top for a contrasting fold-over cuff as shown in the last photo."
