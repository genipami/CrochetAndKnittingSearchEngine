    "content": "no specific gauge any yarn with smaller needles than usually required for a denser fabric this little guy has all the attributes of a monster the beady close-set eyes the vapid and uncomprehending stare the little devil horns that i m sure if he **had** hair he would wear it in an artfully arranged comb-over to hide his true nature and tiny tiny hands knuckles dragging on the ground the perfect thing to make from scraps that you probably could should throw in the bin or scraps of colours you are not keen on for me orange is the most loathsome colour never been a fan in this case the colour envokes orange cats who are said to all share the same brain-cell little orange monster man and his monster friends no matter their colour are probably the same personally my favourite variation is dk weight yarn on 2 5mm needles which makes a small pincushion because inserting the needles sooooo satisfying perfect as a small gift for your like-minded friends but equally as subversive for your not-like-minded frenemies"
