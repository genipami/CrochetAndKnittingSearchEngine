  "notes": "a plain toe-up sock with a shaped arch and ankle, and gusseted short-row heels.\r\n\r\nfrom pattern:\r\n*i like socks that are snug around the arch of my foot but still have enough depth in the heel to not be too stretched across the front of the ankle. also, i prefer to knit socks toe-up as it means i can use an entire ball of wool and make the leg as long as i want. \r\nafter trying many variations on short-row and afterthought heels, and many hours spent measuring and calculating, i came up with this: a well-fitting, slightly pear-shaped but by no means misshapen pair of heels.*\r\n\r\nthis pattern has two editions; both make the same sock. the shorthand edition assumes experience with short-row shaping and uses abbreviated instructions. \r\nthe longhand edition assumes little to no experience with short-row shaping and has more detailed instructions. \r\ni suggest you have a look at both editions and choose the one that makes most sense to you.\r\n\r\n**available in two sizes:** \r\nmedium, large \r\n\r\nmedium is about an eu 38, and was made to my foot measurements. \r\nlarge is about an eu 42, is wider and longer than the medium, and was made to my boyfriend's foot measurements. \r\nyou can adjust the pattern to fit your foot more precisely if you choose: see the boxed hints in the instructions. i suggest you measure around the girth around the arch of your foot to determine the foot width, then make the foot the required length as given in the boxed hints.\r\n\r\n**materials** \r\n300m [350m] 4ply/sock yarn\r\nset of 2.25mm double-pointed needles (or long circular needle for magic-loop) or size required to achieve correct stitch gauge.\r\n2 stitch markers (optional)\r\nwool needle for weaving in ends\r\n\r\n**tension/gauge** \r\ngauge approx. 30 sts x 45 rows over 10cm x 10cm.\r\n\r\n**techniques used** \r\nknit\r\npurl\r\nk1, p1 rib\r\njudy’s magic cast-on\r\njeny's surprisingly stretchy bind-off\r\nshort-row shaping: instructions provided in pattern \r\n"
