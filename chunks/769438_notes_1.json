    "content": "this hat was designed at the request of my friend chantelle and now i m happy to make it available to all you knitters out there i used malabrigo mecha but of course you can substitute another yarn just try to use a bouncy bulky weight yarn with nice stitch definition and be sure to have at least 130 yards the dimensions of the hat may seem small to some but the stitch pattern is very stretchy and this hat easily fits my 22 5 head"
