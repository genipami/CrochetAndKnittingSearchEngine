  "notes": "this cozy little scarf is one of my favorites and is the perfect addition to keep you warm in the cold weather. it fits nicely in the neck of your coat and lays smoothly thanks to the keyhole loop opening that eliminates bulkiness. it's a quick one-skein project too that knits up fast using garter stitch.  free pattern includes printable pdf."
