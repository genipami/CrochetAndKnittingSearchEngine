  "notes": "2 sizes - one i find fits teens and adult women, the other larger one fits men or people with a lot of hair or larger heads.\r\n\r\ncable needle required. \r\n\r\nstriking beanie - easy construction. nice for a beginner cable project as the cables go the same way and look impressive for little effort."
