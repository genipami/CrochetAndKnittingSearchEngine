    "content": "easy beginner pattern this is a quick crochet with lots of texture in a little space it s shown in solid and variegated yarns but a short run self striping yarn would also be cool if you use a 100% cotton yarn you can expect over time for a little bit of shrinkage you can compensate for that if you wish by the number of chains you create in the first row of the pattern"
