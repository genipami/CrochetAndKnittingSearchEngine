  "notes": "**ariose socks**\r\n\r\nthis sock is knit from the cuff down and features a german short row heel, as well as a reinforced flap and gusset heel, to allow you to choose what fits your knitting style. \r\n\r\nthe pattern is charted, but some written instructions are also provided.\r\n\r\nto knit this sock any standard fingering sock yarn will do just fine. light colours and solid or semi-solid colourways will make the pattern look best.\r\n\r\n**please be aware that this pattern has not been tested, which is why i am providing it for free.** \r\n\r\ni hope you will enjoy knitting this design.
