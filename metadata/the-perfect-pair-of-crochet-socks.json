  "notes": "if you ever crocheted a disaster sock before, it probably wasn’t your fault. crochet socks that don’t have the perfect yarn/pattern combination will be too thick, won’t stay up, and can be downright uncomfortable to walk on. that’s not the case with these socks.\r\n\r\nwith this pattern you’ll learn how to crochet a properly fitting sock with the perfect sock yarn. gone are the days you have to skip out on handmade socks because you don’t know how to knit. \r\n\r\nthere is a video tutorial for these socks available on youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zmcl_i3ydi][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zmcl_i3ydi"
