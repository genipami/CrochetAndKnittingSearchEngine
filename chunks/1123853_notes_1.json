    "content": "most of the time i end up with a small amount leftover yarn after finishing a pattern and i have no clue what to do with it so i made the leftover scrunchie pattern this pattern is knit in the round as a long tube then seamed up using the mattress stitch around a standard hair elastic with no metal clasp but it can be very easily modified to be knit flat i made this pattern out of dk yarn since it s a very common yarn and i figured that most people would have dk left over but you can really use any yarn and hold it with others to get the required width i used fingering held double in the pink/blue scrunchie"
