    "content": "-1 or larger this is the back panel width shoulder to shoulder -1 / square size rounded up to next integer e g 20-1 /4 = 4 75 therefore back panel width is 5 squares the length of the back panel is based on the desired shoulder to hem measurement in my case i wanted the cardigan to be at least 24 long this sits just below my bum but whatever length you desire will work so long as it is longer than the sleeve width which is half the sleeve circumference as calculated below work out the number of squares you need to make the cardigan at least the shoulder to hem measurement this is the back panel length shoulder to hem / square size rounded up to next integer e g 24/4 = 6 therefore the back panel length is 6 squares page 3 recipe for a granny square cardigan by insertinnergeek designs the back panel will need a number of squares equal to the back panel width multiplied by the back panel length in my case this was 5 squares by 6 squares so the back panel used 30 squares back panel width x back panel length = back panel squares e g 5 x 6 = 30 squares front panels unless there is a large difference between the front and back parts of the bust/chest measurement e g a large busted person the front panel measurement can be based on at the bust/chest measurement divided by 4 for example 47 divided by 4 is 11 75 if there is a large difference you can approximate the front part of the measurement by the bust/chest measurement minus the shoulder to shoulder measurement and then divide by 2 to get the panel measurement for example 47-21 /2 = 13 to allow for a button band down the middle of the panels the panel measurement needs to be reduced by an inch or so work out how many squares will give you at least your front panel measurement minus 1 this is your front panel width front panel measurement - 1 /square size rounded up to next integer e g 11 75 - 1 /4 = 2 6875 therefore the front panel width is 3 squares your front panels should each be the same length as your back panel that is front panel length equals the back panel length previous calculated front panel width x front panel length = front panel squares e g 3 x 6 = 18 squares sleeves each sleeve will need to me slightly shorter than the shoulder to wrist measurement as the should will drop a little and we will be adding a cuff for example my shoulder to wrist measurement was 20 which would suggest using 5 of my 4 squares however i only needed 4 squares to achieve the right length work out how many squares you will need to make your sleeves 2-5 shorter than your shoulder to wrist measurement this"
