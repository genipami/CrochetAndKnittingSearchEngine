  "notes": "from designer:\r\n*i spotted the most beautiful ball of yarn at my local michaels craft store a few weeks ago. i discovered that caron big cakes has added a few new colors to their line-up and this one, summer berry tart, really caught my eye! and with just one ball i created a triangle shawl! i used the moss stitch (sc + chain 1) which is such a simple beautiful stitch. unlike a traditional sc where you can see a defined front and back of the stitch, the moss stitch allows for perfect little “v’s” on both sides which makes your project completely reversible. plus the self-striping nature of caron big cakes lends itself so well to this stitch and project!*\r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\n* one ball of caron big cakes yarn in summer berry tart\r\n* size h crochet hook\r\n* tapestry needle.\r\n"
