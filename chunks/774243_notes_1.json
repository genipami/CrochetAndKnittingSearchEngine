    "content": "this triangle shawl started as a simple experiment in texture the entire shawl is created with nothing more than knits purls and increases making it an easy project for relaxing at home or on-the-go i used one ball of caron\u00ae cakes\u2122 yarn in the pistachio colorway but this can really be made using any color and yarn use a single color to to highlight the different textures or tame a busy yarn with these basic stitches the pattern is written so that sections can be added or omitted to fit your personal project style credit for the pattern name goes to my daughter who reacted to the finished project by telling me that it looks like you guessed it lettuce i hope you enjoy it"
