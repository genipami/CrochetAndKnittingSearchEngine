    "content": "this pattern can be done with any weight of yarn - baby through sport it is a great way to use up odds and ends from your stash acrylic works best but cotton can also be used cotton hats tend not to be as stretchy though i don t recommend wool since baby items need to be easily washable make sure to select a hook that is appropriate for the yarn you select also as a guideline a preemie sized hat should fit an orange and a normal newborn hat should fit a grapefruit of course with so many people having 9 and 10 pound babies it can also be helpful to make hats a bit bigger than grapefruit sized too for baby gifts i often make a nice blanket then add a set of 3 hats with each hat being a bit bigger than the last in the yarn that co-ordinates with the blanket you can see examples of this in my projects"
