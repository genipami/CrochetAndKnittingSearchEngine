    "content": "this scarf is designed to mimic the knit linen stitch with the perk that it s double sided and is a lot quicker to work up it is worked lengthwise with fringe added at the end if desired variegated yarn is recommended but solid colors can be used to created an alternating pattern of stripes note the yardage amount given is a close approximation less or more yardage can be used to make a shorter/narrower or longer/wider scarf note if it looks like there will be pooling of colors try working every few row or every other row with a second skein or the inside and outside of the ball"
