  "notes": "**this meadow vine reversible cable scarf knitting pattern** creates a beautiful interlocking design inspired by nature. this full-sized adult scarf is knitted in chunky yarn with alternating rope cable columns that display equally on both sides.\r\n\r\n**scarf size**\r\n• unblocked: 6.5 inches (16.5 cm) wide and 70 inches (178 cm) long\r\n• blocked: 7 inches (18 cm) wide and 76 inches (193 cm) long\r\n\r\n**active time to complete**\r\ni estimate this pattern takes approximately 24 to 32 hours to complete. want to knit it faster? you may adjust your length and/or width accordingly if desired. additionally, you may modify this pattern with different yarn weights and appropriately sized knitting needles.\r\n\r\n**knitting techniques**\r\n• co = cast on long tail\r\n• k = knit stitch \r\n• p = purl stitch\r\n• 4/4r = right crossing reversible cable\r\n• 4/4l = left crossing reversible cable\r\n• cast off\r\n• weave in yarn tails\r\n\r\n**blocking:** for the best results, i encourage blocking your piece. as a result, doing so allows the meadow vine cable texture to display beautifully, as well as creating a more pliable piece."
