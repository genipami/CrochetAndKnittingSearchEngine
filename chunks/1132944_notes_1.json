    "content": "this sock features a simple mosaic pattern that reminds me of the many blibbities and blobbities these are undoubtedly the proper technical terms on a circuit board the instructions are for a sock that is worked cuff-down with a heel flap but the pattern can be adapted quite easily for toe-up and other types of heels there are 3 sizes small medium large with 60 72 84 stitches per round instructions are written and the mosaic pattern is both written and charted you may use any technique/needles you prefer for knitting a tube in the round you will need two colours of fingering weight sock yarn with good contrast you are free to sell anything you make using this pattern but please do not sell the pattern itself or otherwise claim it as your own"
