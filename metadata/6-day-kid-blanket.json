[here is an article][12] to help you decide how to change colors if you would like a different effect.\r\n\r\ni'm sorry, i don't know who made the lion applique either, but you can find one by googling crochet lion applique.\r\n\r\nat long last and after many requests, i present the [6-day star blanket variation][13].\r\n\r\nyou may find the [6-day kid blanket cheat sheet][14] and [coloring pages][15] helpful add-ons to this pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou can also make a \r\n[6-day kid blanket hat][16]\r\na [6-day kid blanket scarf][17]\r\na [6-day kid blanket shrug][18]\r\na [6-day kid blanket shrug hoodie][19]\r\na [6-day kid blanket pocket shawl][20]\r\na [6-day kid blanket sideways pocket shawl][21]\r\n\r\n## www.bettymcknit.com ##\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucio76solzk9ihju_bjytvzg\r\n  [2]: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl7nqcs3aaidtaextmzq16i9fgwrnnside\r\n  [3]: http://bettymcknit.com/2018/11/13/6dkbgraph/\r\n  [4]: https://www.facebook.com/groups/6daykidblanket\r\n  [5]: https://www.facebook.com/bettymcknit\r\n  [6]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucio76solzk9ihju_bjytvzg\r\n  [7]: https://youtu.be/19g-befahr4\r\n  [8]: https://www.facebook.com/bettymcknit\r\n  [9]: https://www.facebook.com/groups/6daykidblanket\r\n  [10]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kmz8ekem6k&t=4s\r\n  [11]: https://www.pinterest.com/bettymcknit\r\n  [12]: https://bettymcknit.com/2021/06/27/6dkbstripes/\r\n  [13]: https://www.bettymcknit.com/6daystarblanket\r\n  [14]: https://betty-mcknit.myshopify.com/products/6-day-kid-blanket-cheat-sheet-betty-mcknit\r\n  [15]: https://betty-mcknit.myshopify.com/products/6-day-kid-blanket-coloring-page-betty-mcknit\r\n  [16]: https://www.bettymcknit.com/6dkb-hat\r\n  [17]: https://www.bettymcknit.com/6dkbscarf1\r\n  [18]: https://www.bettymcknit.com/6dkbshrug\r\n  [19]: https://www.bettymcknit.com/6dkbshrughoodie\r\n  [20]: https://www.bettymcknit.com/6dkbpocketshawl\r\n  [21]: https://www.bettymcknit.com/6dkbsidewayspocketshawl"
