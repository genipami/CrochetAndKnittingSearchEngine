    "content": "basic crochet chain hat jennifer johnson materials yarn i used wendy fusion yarn because the colour changes are pretty it used approximately 80 yards so you will only get one hat out of a 96 yard skein but you will have useful scraps left over and/or some flexibility in cutting the yarn to arrange the colours as you want them however any yarn could be used thinner yarns will need to have more circuits of the head than bulky yarns as they will build up more slowly into a denser mesh crochet hook i used a 5 5mm crochet hook as suggested on the wendy fusion ball band use whatever size hook your yarn suggests for best results tapestry needle for tucking the loose ends in once you finish pattern \uf0b7 co one stitch this canjust be a knot d \uf0b7 crochet 2 more stitches in a chain then make a 3rd stitch in the chain joined to your original stitch \uf0b7 do more 3-stitch long chains always turning your work in the same direction to form a spiral attach the 3rd stitch of each chain to the middle 2nd stitch of the closest chain on the row before e g you basically just keep making a long chain but reattach it to the core of the hat on every third stitch this will form a dense flower-shaped disc for the top of the hat \uf0b7 when 3-stitch long chains start to get stretched and not easily reach between the centres of the chains on the row before switch to doing 5-stitch chains instead these still get attached to the centre stitch of the row before \uf0b7 when the 5-stitch chains start to get stretched switch to using 7-stitch chains these get attached to the centre stitch of the row before as always \uf0b7 once you feel that the hat is large enough do one round of normal crochet building up from all the 7-stitch chains in the last row to reinforce the edge \uf0b7 bind off and weave in ends using tapestry needle on the wendy fusion hat the dense flower section is just less than 3 inches diameter the 5-stitch section is approximately 3 5 inches deep and the 7-stitch section is approximately 2 5 inches deep using thinner yarn your bands will be less deep and so you may need to also have a band of 9-stitch long chains around the edge to make the hat large enough the best way to get this hat to fit exactly is to try it on as you make it"
