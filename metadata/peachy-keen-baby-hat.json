  "notes": "this baby hat features classic toque styling, in miniature! \r\nself-striping sock yarn does all the heavy lifting allowing you to speed through a very easy pattern - easy enough to be your very first hat!\r\n\r\npattern instructions are written out for both seamed and seamless versions, depending on if you prefer to knit on straight needles or in the round. advice is also included for adjusting the pattern for larger or smaller babies, and working the hat without a fold-up brim. please do not hesitate to message me if you have any questions about adjusting the pattern.\r\n\r\nfor the hat in the picture, i used only 74 yards/15 grams of a 50g ball of sirdar snuggly crofter baby 4ply in shade 194 jocelyn. crofter baby 4ply is a very soft acrylic/nylon blend good for gifting to mothers who need low-maintenance knits, or for donating to hospitals. you can get three hats out of one 50g ball - plus, this hat is also perfect for using up your sock leftovers!",
