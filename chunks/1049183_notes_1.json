    "content": "the flower is 9 across i made this pattern for flowers to be used for yarn bombing i used acrylic yarn to hold up to the elements outdoors it s made holding 2 strands together to make the flower as stiff as possible i can see it being used for any type of decoration added to a hat or a bag or used as a doily to set a vase on it has a bit of 3 dimensions as the 2 row of petals sit on top of each other this is a fun project because it is so fast i crochet while we watch tv and finished this up in an evening i made it for a yarn bombing project if you haven t seen that it s when people make coverings and decorations for things in the neighborhood like trees and bike racks and fences it brings a smile to peoples faces and can brighten up a dreary spot it s a great stash buster especially for those odds and ends of acrylic yarns the stiffer the better for this the acrylic holds up better to the elements in the second version of the flower i used gold and brown for the center for the petals i used a bright yellow for both row then paired it with a lighter yellow on the front row and a darker yellow on the back row"
