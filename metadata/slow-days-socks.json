  "notes": "sometimes, you need to knit socks without knowing the exact measurements of the person who will wear them. in these cases, 2x2 ribbing is your best friend—it offers excellent stretch and a snug fit across various foot sizes and shapes.\r\n\r\nmaterials\r\n\r\nyarn: fingering weight sock yarn (~400 m / 100 g). \r\nlight speckled or gradient yarns work especially well with this pattern.\r\ni used ursa major mirror line from apmezga for the blue pair and mille colori from lang yarns for the striped version. opal tea time would also be a great choice.\r\nneedles: 2.25 mm (us 1) long circular needles for magic loop, or double-pointed needles (dpns)\r\nnotions: scissors, tapestry needle, measuring tape, stitch markers\r\n\r\nsizes\r\n\r\nthis pattern is written for three sizes, based on stitch count:\r\n\r\n* 60 stitches 64 stitches 68 stitches"
