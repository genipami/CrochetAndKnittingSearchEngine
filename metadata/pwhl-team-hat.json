  "notes": "show off your pwhl team support all season long with this fun toque!\r\n\r\nfor my montreal sample i used berroco ultra wool in: sour cherry, smoke and cream. \r\nthe hat uses very little wool overall so one ball of each color should be totally fine in most worsted weight yarns.\r\n\r\ni knit mine on 4mm 16in circulars in size medium with the shorter brim option. choose a needle size that works for you and if you want your ribbing tighter, i recommend using a smaller size and then switching for the body (totally up to you!).\r\n\r\noverall, this is a super easy knit with a straight forward two colour chart that keeps you entertained for the body of the hat. plus you get some pwhl gear in the end! :smile: "
