    "content": "one of our customers described this pattern as the mother load of bags and bowls there are six patterns included two bowls two single handled bags and two 2-handled bags they are all designed to use up your stash of left over feltable yarn the pattern is designed for bulky yarn but you can always substitute two strands of worsted weight held together the patterns are designed for weight of yarn rather than yardage so it takes most of the guesswork out so grab your kitchen scale and get started they are all quick and easy projects some have suggested striping but feel free to just do your own thing"
