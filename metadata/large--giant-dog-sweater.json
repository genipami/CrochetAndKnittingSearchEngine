  "notes": "this free crochet sweater pattern for large dogs, extra large, and extra extra large dogs is perfect for our long-legged furry friends. one thing i noticed while designing the extra small, small, and medium dog sweater pattern is that with larger dogs it can be difficult to get their long legs into conventionally styled dog sweaters. \r\n\r\nif your tall pet doesn’t like their legs manipulated into a sweater with leg holes – who can blame them? – they’ll love you for using this pattern as it incorporates a flap with buttons. simply slip the collar over their head and fasten below.\r\n\r\n"
