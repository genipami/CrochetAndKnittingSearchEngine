    "content": "the fiesta swirl hat is a free crochet pattern on my blog this hat is worked sideways as a parallelogram shape which is then folded seamed then cinched to close the top this shape creates the swirl when the ends are folded together with bold color transitions provided by self-striping yarn in a repetitive stitch pattern makes this hat easy and fun to make easy to customize to any size simply by adding or subtracting row easy stitch throughout - a single_crochet stitch worked in the back loop only creating textured ridges for a ribbed look this stitch also creates a stretchy and forgiving fit the match to the fiesta swirl scarf https //www ravelry com/patterns/library/fiesta-swirl-scarf"
