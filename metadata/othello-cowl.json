  "notes": "the othello cowl pattern is made for almost-instant gratification. with one skein of bulky yarn, you can knit one cowl in one day!\r\n\r\ni used the lusciously soft, bulky wool from canadian yarn company koigu for a warm, next-to-skin treat that keeps the neck and chest warm and fits inside a winter coat or light jacket.\r\n\r\nthe othello cowl features a folded top hem for a polished edge with stretch. it's knit from the top down in the round, then it's divided into a triangular kerchief-style piece of flat knitting to flow over your shoulders and provide extra warmth at the front where coats tend to gape.\r\n\r\nit has i-cord edges made with a little trick to keep them from becoming too tight.\r\n\r\nthe bubble stitch pattern does a few things:\r\n\r\nit's great for enhancing variegated yarn colours\r\nit looks amazing and textural using solids and tonal yarns\r\nit adds texture and air pockets for warmth\r\nit makes the knitting fun and interesting!\r\n\r\nknit a few of these one-skein cowls for quick gift knitting.\r\n\r\nyou can knit a cotton version of it using loopy mango big cotton yarns, too!\r\n\r\nany bulky yarn with a knitted gauge of about 3 sts per inch will work. look for ball bands that say 100 g = 95 yds / 86 m, or 50 g = 48 yds / 43 m.\r\n\r\nthe sample used about 82 grams of koigu othello yarn in the winter train colourway and was knit using an 8mm / us 11 knitting needle."
