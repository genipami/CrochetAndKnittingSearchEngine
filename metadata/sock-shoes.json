  "notes": "**these socks were part of sock madness 2025**.\r\n\r\nthese socks look as if they were socks worn in shoes.\r\n\r\nthey are worked from the top down with a heel flap and gussets. \r\n\r\nthe technique is slipped sts in two colors and the colors are reversed on the heel and the sole and separated from the leg and the instep by a braid worked as a vikkel braid on the horizontal part and a slipped stitch or a little cable around.\r\n\r\nthe same amount of yarn is needed for both colors.\r\n\r\n**typo**\r\nin the abbreviation section, p should be: p on rs (k on ws)",
