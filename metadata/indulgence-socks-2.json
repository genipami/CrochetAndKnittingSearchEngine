  "notes": "it all started with looking through my stash, picking out the earthy coloured balls of yarn and thinking what to do with only 1 ball of each colours. it was a cold winter morning and my feet just couldn’t warm up. i need some warm cosy socks! and there is nothing better than handmade socks. i paired the natural wool with silk mohair to add strength and extra softness. whilst knitting them i gave each sock a different name. and because they just look so scrumptious i named the collection \"indulgence socks\".\r\n\r\nyarn: \r\npalette 50g (100% peruvian highland wool) held together with drops silk mohair 25g | both fingering weight | palette 231yds drops 210yds = 1 strand of each yarn held together.\r\n\r\nneedles: \r\n3mm (us 2.5)\r\nfor sample used addi 9inch circular needles. tapestry needles to weave the ends in. stitch markers or scrap yarn.\r\n\r\ngauge:\r\n30 sts / 30 rounds = 10 x 10 cm / 4 x 4 inches, knitted in the round in stockinette stitch and blocked\r\n\r\nsizes:\r\n1 (2) 3 (4) finished sock circumference: 18 / 20.5 / 23 / 25.5cm ( 7 / 8 / 9 / 10inch ), to be worn with slight ease. skeins of each yarn = 1 (1) 2 for 1 pair of socks. if you are planning to make the cuffs longer or foot size larger than 6uk (us8) i suggest you get 2 skeins of each yarn.\r\n\r\nplease note: the pattern features a \"yarn over short row heel\" not a german short row heel.\r\n",
