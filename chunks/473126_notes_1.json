    "content": "this blanket is an incredibly simple pattern that produces a very lovely textured finish that looks like you ve done something far more intricate this is a fantastic mindless crochet pattern to work on - very meditative once you get going no need to think this is not a very large blanket as i originally designed them in a size that was recommended to me by the staff of our local nicu to fit a humidi-crib you can make yours whatever size that you wish - just ensure that your initial fdsc is an even number then work as many row as you like until you reach your desired blanket size gauge is not terribly important with this pattern it can be worked in any yarn that takes your fancy - i only used the soft as it s lovely and cuddly it can also be worked in stripes if you wish - whatever you d like in my pics you will see that i made these in both traditional and non-traditional baby colours - the ones that look striped are actually all of my blankets folded in boxes ready to go 40cms x 60cms is an approximate size as i just continued working until i used up the whole 2 x 80gram balls - finished off at last completed row"
