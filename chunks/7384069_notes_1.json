    "content": "i love the look of peppermint candy canes so i decided to design a diagonal scarf that looks like one to get the peppermint candy cane look you will need one skein of red and one skein of white i used big twist value from joann a worsted weight yarn in colors deep red and white you will need less than one skein of each color this scarf is easily adjustable add more chains at the beginning for a wider scarf reduce the number of chains at the beginning for a thinner scarf add row if you would like the scarf to be longer reduce row if you would like the scarf to be shorter this pattern can be a little tricky at first due to the increases and decreases but it s suitable for a beginner crocheter looking for a little challenge"
