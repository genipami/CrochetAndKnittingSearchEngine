    "content": "a decptively simple lace construction that is based on a rather neat principle where columns travel around the leg because the effect is rather ordered and systematic i would call this a masculine lace if there is such a thing please note to achieve the clear effect nearly all knit stitches are knitted through the back loop equally some of the decreases are twisted to give a uniform effect this could be changed to normal k sts and the decreases could be changed to k2tog and ssk but i would suggest you try the sts as described because it will improve the stitch definition a lot please also note that this pattern has not been test knit so please let me know if there are mistakes or clarity problems **errata ** please note that the instructions for the toe could be misleading the plain non decrease rounds are simply marked as k but this should read work sts as established i e k the k sts p the p sts and ktbl the ktbl sts sorry for any confusion"
