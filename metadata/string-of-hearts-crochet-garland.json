  "notes": "beginner friendly, a yarn stash buster, a fun project to sneak in before valentine’s day = this string of hearts garland!\r\n\r\nthis garland uses slip stitch, double crochet, and even triple crochet! \r\n\r\n\r\nmaterials\r\n\r\n    yarn – size 4 or 5*\r\n    hook – 8.00 mm hook for size 4 yarn, 10.00 mm hook for size 5 yarn\r\n    scissors\r\n    spray starch, thin cotton cloth, iron\r\n\r\nmaterial notes:\r\n\r\n* you can use any type of yarn. i used size 4, acrylic, loops and thread impeccable yarn in “red hot” from michaels and size 5, wool and acrylic, hue + me yarn in “rose water” from lion brand. wool yarn looks the best for this project, but less expensive acrylic yarn comes in a close second, plus it makes more sense for seasonal decor. if you use cotton yarn, i recommend using a stiffer cotton, not mercerized (shiny). you may also need to go down a hook size if the heart looks too open and misshapen.\r\nnote: i do not recommend using a super bulky or size 6 yarn or larger because the hearts get too puffy and misshapen. of course do what you want. if you do go up that large, i recommend using a 12 mm hook. you can also use a size 2 or 3 yarn for itty bitty hearts. you’ll have to experiment to see which hook will work best.\r\n\r\nsizing\r\n\r\nbecause you have to crochet a base of chains to start, you have to decide ahead of time how long you want your garland to be.\r\n\r\nthe hearts tend to stretch out a little when pressed and hung, so i have listed an approximate range for the width of each heart. the weight stays the same though, so i listed the weight of each heart to help you determine how many hearts you can make with the amount of yarn you have. this project makes for a great stash buster!\r\n\r\nsize 4 yarn\r\n\r\n    1 heart = approx. 1 g\r\n    1 heart = approx. 2.25 to 2.75 inches wide (5.72 – 6.99 cm)*\r\n    6 ft. garland = approx. 29 hearts\r\n\r\nsize 5 yarn\r\n\r\n    1 heart = approx. 3 g\r\n    1 heart = approx. 3.0 – 3.125 inches (7.62 – 7.94 cm)*\r\n    6 ft. garland = approx. 25 hearts\r\n\r\ngauge\r\n\r\nthere is no gauge, but be aware that if you crochet looser or tighter than the heart sizes i listed above, this may affect how long your garland is and how much yarn you’ll need to complete it. \r\n"
