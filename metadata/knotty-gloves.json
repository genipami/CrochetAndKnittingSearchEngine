  "notes": "available in \r\n\r\n* english\r\n* german\r\n* french\r\n\r\na basic glove pattern fitting women's l (or men's s). the cable on the wrist adds some interest but can be left out if you don't feel like doing cables.\r\ndownsizing: use a gauge of 36sts/4inches to get a women's m (17cm circumference).\r\nto make the cable really pop out avoid multicolored yarns, stay with semi solids in light colors. the darker the yarn the less shadows the colorwork will have = the less it will be visible\r\n\r\nthe cable pattern is included as a chart.\r\n"
