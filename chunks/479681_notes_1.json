    "content": "this is a symmetrical all over two-color slip_stitch design i based my idea on tiling which is prevalent in turkey the final result is an attractively textured and patterned cloth although not strictly reversible the reverse side echoes the pattern on the front you will be able to make more than two from one ball of each color the i love this cotton will be slightly smaller i created this pattern for my weekly dishcloth group and this pattern is dedicated to all my knitting and crocheting friends there this pattern looks best with two strongly contrasting colors however which color you choose for the main color will make a difference to how your final dishcloth looks see my orange and brown project notes i have test-knitted the dishcloth pattern using both written and charted instructions but please do not hesitate to contact me if you find a mistake or need help clarifying an instruction"
