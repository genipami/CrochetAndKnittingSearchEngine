    "content": "that they have a tendency to stuff their dolls very very firmly one person said like a brick and a lot of people use cotton yarn too which doesn t have much give if this is you you may not be able to manipulate your dolls into the clothing as easily as i can as although i stuff my dolls firmly i don t stuff them so firmly that i cannot pull and/or push them into the clothing with ease i also use acrylic yarn for my dolls and their clothing which has a lot of stretch to it therefore if you tend to stuff your dolls very firmly so that that the dolls body has very little give or use cotton yarn it is highly recommended that you go up at least one hook size when making the clothing within this pattern i have noted in the individual patterns when there is a good point at which to try the pieces on before you work any further so that you can rework what you have done so far with a different sized hook if you need to ~ ~ special stitches twisted single_crochet tw single_crochet stitches are worked from the right to the left insert hook into st yo pull through a loop 2 loops on hook make them loose rotate the hook towards yourself and around 360 degrees yo and draw through two loops on hook here s a link to a video which shows how to do it http //www gosyo co jp/siteimage/kagi_ami/32/32_kagi wmv if this link does not work there are videos on youtube this st is very similar to the crab st so if you find it difficult to work you can substitute it with the crab st important information as you work try the dress and shoes on your doll to check the fit if it is working up too large try it again going down a hook size or two if it is working up too small try it again going up a hook size or two things can work up differently due to chosen yarn brand and weight - different brands can differ vastly and even different colours in the same brand can work up differently your chosen hook size and your own personal gauge/gauge will also effect how an item works up your personal gauge/gauge can even change from hour to hour e g if you make something wide awake vs when you re tired the difference a hook size can make can be amazing and makes these patterns very flexible feel free to work more or less repeat row or rounds too to make garments longer or shorter i e these are row and rounds that have the same amount of stitches that you work to simply increase the length of something pattern start nelly s dress ch17 not too tightly chain should fit around doll s neck if not go up in hook size until it does row 1"
