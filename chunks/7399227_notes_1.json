    "content": "i loved this stitch pattern sprinkling puffs between simple double_crochet stitches let me achieve exactly the look i was going for as i was working i couldn t decide if the puff stitches looked more like hearts or leaves climbing up the blanket i love that the puff stitches look the same on either side of the blanket yay for no wrong side while i decided to crochet a baby blanket with this free pattern i ve also included ten other sizes ranging from lovey to king in case you want to make a larger project there s a chart letting you know all the details for each size plus i ll include information so you can make this crochet project any size you want i used a worsted weight variegated yarn for my crochet baby blanket but i think using a pretty solid or heathered yarn would be just as beautiful it is possible to use a bulky weight yarn for this blanket but just remember it will change the finished size of your final product * i used 1200 yd almost 3 skeins of hobbii cascata in the shade angel 01 * for the border i used hobbii amigo xl in the shade white"
