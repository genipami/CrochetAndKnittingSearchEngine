  "notes": "pattern for a crocheted armadillo that can be rolled into a ball. only palm-sized when made from dk yarn, this is a fun little creature that can be completed very quickly. use brown or grey yarn with simple black eyes for a realistic armadillo, or go fancy with any colors and embellishments for a cutesy toy look.\r\n\r\nwritten in english using us crochet terms. unlike most amigurumi this pattern uses mostly half double crochet for the body (i included a small tutorial about how to make invisible decrease with this stitch type). pattern also uses single and double crochet, puff stitch and optionally crab stitch; i would classify this as an intermediate level project.",
