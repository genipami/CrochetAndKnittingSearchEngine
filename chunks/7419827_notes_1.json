    "content": "**assigned pooling is not just for knitters ** like rare inclusions in a gemstone the special puff stitches worked as assigned pooling in the pedras preciosas shawl make each piece a unique work of art as the width of your work grows the pops of color appear in new places forming an organic pattern that looks to have been created by the forces of nature the finished piece is versatile for many styles and outfits used as a scarf or wrap yarn & hook you ll need between 490 600 yards of #3 dk weight yarn and a hook in us size g-6 7 or h-8 4 0 - 5 0 mm the yarn itself should be appropriately dyed for assigned pooling in almost all cases this yarn will be sold in a hank format you want to find a colorway that has easy to identify contrasting color sections with a short section usually \u00bc or less of the color you ll assign for the alternate stitch the more contrast between this assigned color and the rest of the color section s the better if you re unsure unwind the hank and lay it out in a circle you should be able to see the pop of color all pooled together taking up only a small part of the circumference the pictured sample was crocheted with 490 yards of an 75/25 blend of superwash merino wool and nylon depending on the fiber content of the yarn you choose the yardage by weight will vary exact yardage isn t critical as the overall finished size is up to your preference and the pattern can end on any row if you want a larger finished size or if the yarn you re using is less than 245 yds/100oz assume you ll need at least part of a 3rd skein and purchase from the same dye lot from the start gauge is also not critical and you can stop on any row when the work is sized how you would like it as a baseline for you to compare to the pictured sample has a gauge of 14 stitches and 19 row per 4 inches before blocking using a g-6 hook if your gauge is tighter more stitches/row per 4 inches you may need to work up more row to achieve a desirable size if your gauge is looser less stitches/row per 4 inches you ll reach a larger size more quickly substitutions feel free to experiment with other yarn weights the pattern won t change but the gauge and yardage will size up your hook accordingly and note that the pattern hasn t been tested for these substitutions so you ll be making some assumptions on yardage finished measurements the pictured sample measures 48 122cm across the widest part of the wingspan and 14 36cm from the flat edge across the top to the point at the bottom work more or less row to reach the size you want the piece to"
