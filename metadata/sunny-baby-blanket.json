  "notes": "**from the pattern description:** *of course this blanket can be knit in any color you please, but bright yellow brings an extra spark of joy and light. a pretty textured pattern makes it even livelier. the more you wash this yarn, the softer it gets.*\r\n\r\n29\" circular needle recommended in pattern instructions.  blanket is knit flat.\r\n\r\n**finished size:** 30-1/2 x 34\" (77.5x86.5cm)"
