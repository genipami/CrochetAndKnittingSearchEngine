    "content": "sometimes you just want a quick instant gratification project that you can finish in one evening this scarf complements the n\u00f8rrebro hat and is just that kind of project combining simple ribbing with a sand stitch for the perfect squishy unisex scarf both the hat and scarf patterns are named after n\u00f8rrebro the suburb of copenhagen where i saw a lady rocking a similar- looking hat to the n\u00f8rrebro hat 1 this scarf is pretty freeform so the gauge is just a guideline you can make it wider thinner longer shorter or even convert it into an infinity scarf version if i try that i ll include those instructions as well have fun with it and happy knitting 1 http //www ravelry com/patterns/library/the-nrrebro-hat"
