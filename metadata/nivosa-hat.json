(other stretchy cast on may be used if you have a preferred one.) \r\nthe body of the hat continues with snowflake inspired colorwork that can be done in dark color on a light background as shown in sample or can be reversed to get very different effect. any two colors may be used depending on knitter’s preference.\r\ncrown is shaped with simple knit two together decreases in just a few rows which results in a slightly gathered shape which is perfect for topping with a pompom. \r\n\r\n[complete nivosa hat video tutorial][1]\r\n[crochet cast on and joining in the round tutorial][2]\r\n[beginner friendly stranded colorwork technique tutorial ][3]\r\n[fleece lining for a hat tutorial][4]\r\n[faux fur pompom for a hat tutorial][5]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemur-_oapg\r\n  [2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbuajolhbki\r\n  [3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yuei1vrkg\r\n  [4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byc3pgld4t4\r\n  [5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfj4gdidnqy",
