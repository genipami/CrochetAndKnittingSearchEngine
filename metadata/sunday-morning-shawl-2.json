  "notes": "> espace tricot is a yarn store in montreal, canada. [discover our yarns here.][1]\r\n\r\nour sunday morning dk yarn is a deliciously rustic yet soft blend of bluefaced leicester and masham fibres spun and dyed in england. the unique blend of naturally brown and off-white fibres creates a heathered effect which brings depth and dimension.\r\n\r\nas a nod to the coziness and slower pace of sunday mornings, our sunday morning shawl is a relaxing, lightly textured design worked in alternate sections of stockinette and twisted rib. a row of sweet bobbles before the twisted rib border adds a little drama and whimsy.\r\n\r\na lovely, uncomplicated project for those moments when you simply want to immerse yourself in the meditative peace of the stitches.\r\n\r\nsample shown in the colourway offline\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.espacetricot.com"
