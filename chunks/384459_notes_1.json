    "content": "i bought this yarn while i was up at sock summit 11 and wanted it to be more than just plain vanilla socks i saw a chevron pattern in one of my stitch pattern books and thought it would be fun to see the stripes zig zag and so the pattern was born it s an incredibly easy pattern with only 2 row to do and one of them is knit all stitches around the pattern is easily memorized and is great travel knitting because the chevrons pull the stitches a bit tight go up a needle size from what you normally would use my regular sock needle size is a us 1 2 25 mm so that s why this calls for us 1 5 2 5 mm if your usually sock needle size is already 1 5 2 5 mm go up to a us 2 2 75 mm even thought it s written as toe up you could easily knit this cuff down because the chevrons will look the same both ways please join others who are knitting my patterns or who watch my podcast in the mel-tran designs 1 group 1 http //www ravelry com/groups/mel-tran-designs"
