  "notes": "these are four patterns for simple, yet beautiful textured washcloths.\r\n\r\neach one uses about one ball of cotton yarn and takes between one-two hours to complete.\r\n\r\nthey are suitable for beginners and a quick project for intermediate crocheters. \r\n\r\nthe first pattern in the set comes with a video that demonstrates the building of the washcloth and the edging. the edging is the same for all the washcloths.\r\n\r\nthe different stitch combinations are a lot of fun to learn and to combine into a set of washcloths. make one, or make many and gift them to family and friends.
