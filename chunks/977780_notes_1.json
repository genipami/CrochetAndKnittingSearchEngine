    "content": "this scarf can easily be made to whatever dimensions you want typically for an adult i d recommend about 6 feet in length not counting fringe or trim by 7 or 8 inches wide this scarf is worked in long row along the length of the scarf half-double crochets in back loops only create a lovely texture that s simple but not boring and it s a quick scarf to work up gauge is not crucial for this project the sample was stitched with a bulky yarn and a k hook your fabric should be squishy not firm adjust hook size as needed"
