  "notes": "this is an easy, half a granny shape that will form a triangular shawl.  \r\n\r\nit is started at the top, and you can use any yarn, with any hook, and in any gauge, and make the shawl to any size. as such, it's great for both stash busting and for charity!\r\n\r\nthis shawl was formerly known as the alpaca shawl.\r\n\r\nif you have any questions or comments or just want to join like-minded souls, please join my ravelry group at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/anastacia-knits-designs. thanks!\r\n\r\n",
