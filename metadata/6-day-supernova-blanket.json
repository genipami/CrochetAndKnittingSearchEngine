  "notes": "this pattern is adaptable. the blanket can be made in virtually any yarn and you can continue to grow it as big as you want it. \r\napproximate yardage for 2 common sizes and weights:\r\nfor dk or #3 weight yarn you will need approximately 1200 yards for a 40” baby blanket and 2000 yards for a 60” throw-sized blanket.\r\n\r\nfor worsted or #4 weight yarn you will need approximately 1000 yards for a 40” baby blanket and 2400 yards for a 60” throw-sized\r\n\r\nhooks: test crocheters have found that we needed a slightly larger hook than we would normally use to avoid curling. most worked the #3 weight with an h or 5 mm hook, and the worsted with a k or 6.5 mm hook.\r\n"
