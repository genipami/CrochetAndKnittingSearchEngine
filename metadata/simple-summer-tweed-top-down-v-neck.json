  "notes": "thank you [marianne topping][1] for the danish translation.\r\n\r\na very basic top down raglan with almost no seaming required.  includes sizing / shaping for both men and women, and (despite its name) a crew-neck variation as well.  it is designed to be a casual, loose fit, but could easily be made more fitted by increasing the waist shaping rows and choosing a size that fits more closely.  the neck trim can also be left off for a more open v-neck.  \r\n\r\n**suitable for a knitter with some experience**. please review the pattern before you start (it's free!!).  while the *sweater* is simple, you may not find the *instructions* simple, as they are quite basic, so if you have never made a top down raglan before, you may need to find a tutorial first to help visualize the raglan increases.\r\n\r\nthere are **3 actions taking place at the same time**: 1) the raglan incs for the front & back, 2) the raglan incs for the sleeves, 3) the incs for the v-neck. they do not all happen at the same rate, therefore they are given as separate instructions. you can follow the instructions as given which requires you look at your work, and depending which section you are in and when you made the last inc, determine if it’s time to work another inc or not.\r\n\r\nif you prefer to think of it as row by row, you will need to transpose the instructions in that format.\r\n\r\nany other questions should be posted [here][2].\r\n\r\na separate sheet with the finished measurements **in inches** is provided compliments of [yvonne][3].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/people/tullemomsemor\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/discuss/heidi-kirrmaier/2341784/201-225#205\r\n  [3]: http://www.ravelry.com/people/yvonnegut"
