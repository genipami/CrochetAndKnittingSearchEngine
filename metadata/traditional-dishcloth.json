  "notes": "i am offering this tutorial (pattern + instructional videos) for free! this is a traditional pattern, not my own design, that has been used for generations. i am presenting this for beginning knitters who would like to learn this technique, and to give a free sample of my video tutorials.\r\n\r\nfor knitters, knitting a dishcloth is similar to a chef cooking a perfect egg. it is a chance to really focus on basic skills and do them well. in knitting, that means beautiful stitches, even edge tension, and tidy finishing work. \r\n\r\nupdate - this pattern now includes instructions for making rectangular dishcloths, any size.\r\n\r\ni have dozens more video tutorials, including learn to knit socks, learn to knit lace, and learn to knit a raglan sweater.  they are available on [my website][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://verypink.com/category/tutorials/ ",
