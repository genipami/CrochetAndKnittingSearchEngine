  "notes": "the sleepy seaside sweater is like a deep breath of salty air. with its relaxed, boxy shape and wide neckline designed for that effortless off-the-shoulder look, this sweater is made for slow mornings and seaside sunsets. the slightly open, mesh-like stitches make it lightweight and breathable, while long cuffed sleeves add that perfect touch of coziness. a contrasting yarn is carried through the stitches to create a dreamy, wave-like effect—no two sweaters will ever be quite the same. includes a full video tutorial so you can stitch along at your own pace.\r\n\r\n[this pattern is free on my blog!][1]\r\n\r\n[a lion brand kit is available for the sleepy seaside sweater.][2] it comes with all the yarn needed to make your top plus a free copy of the pdf digital download of the pattern. you can also customize your yarn colors. \r\n\r\n[a full video tutorial is included in the pattern and available on my youtube channel.][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.eandpcrochet.com/the-sleepy-seaside-sweater-crochet-pattern/\r\n  [2]: http://shrsl.com/4vrk1\r\n  [3]: https://youtu.be/188jfj2dwm0"
