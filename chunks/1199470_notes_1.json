    "content": "if you know how to half_double_crochet you can easily make this simple scarf for your favorite pup i ve written it for worsted weight yarn in three different sizes but it would be very easy to adapt the pattern for different yarns or sizes disclaimer it should go without saying but your pup should only wear this when supervised it s great for a winter walk holiday photos or christmas day with the family but don t leave it on if they re heading outside or will be home alone safety before cuteness"
