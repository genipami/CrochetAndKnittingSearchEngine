[click here.][1]**\r\n\r\nen castellano, aquí:\r\nhttps://www.barcelonaknits.com/patron-barcelona-knits-2024/\r\n\r\nenglish version here: https://www.barcelonaknits.com/barcelona-knits-2024-pattern/?lang=en\r\n\r\n**port vell** is a seamless cowl worked bottom up in the round. it combines three panels of textured motifs framed by ‘welts’ (or ‘tucks’) and 2x2 ribbing edges. the cowl comes in two\r\n sizes. \r\n\r\nthe textured panels are inspired by the timeless knit and purl motives of gansey sweaters, which i adore! also, it is super fun to knit!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**measurements**\r\nsize 1 is for a regular-sized cowl.\r\nsize 2 can be wrapped around your neck twice. \r\nfinished circumference: approx. 50 (115) cm / 20 (46)”.\r\nheight: approx. 32.5 (32.5) cm / 13 (13)”.\r\n \r\n**yarn and yardage**\r\napprox 290 (710) m of fingering-weight yarn or 320 (760) m of sport-weight yarn.\r\nsample is knit in nadir by lalanalu in colorway ‘crudo’ (100% merino wool, 100 grams, 380 meters).\r\n \r\n**needles**\r\n­—  3.25 mm circular needle (or needle size to obtain gauge).\r\n­—  if working the purl welt, 3 mm circular needle (or a size below gauge size needle).\r\nswatch to find the right needle size for your own tension and yarn choice.\r\n \r\n**gauge**\r\n30 sts x 40 rounds = 10 x 10 cm / 4 x 4” in stockinette stitch on larger needle after blocking.\r\ngauge is not crucial for this project but it will affect yardage and the finished measurements. \r\n\r\n**notions**\r\nblocking tools, scissors, tapestry needle, stitch markers, and tape measure. a row counter might come in handy.\r\noptional: a second set of gauge-size or below-gauge-size needles to work the welts and tubular cast on.\r\noptional: scrap yarn (for the tubular cast-on).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.barcelonaknits.com/patron-barcelona-knits-2024/"
