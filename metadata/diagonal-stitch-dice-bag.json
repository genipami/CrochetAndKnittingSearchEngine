  "notes": "use any worsted weight yarn, sample was created using 25 g of lion brand wool ease. this project is perfect for using up scraps of yarn left over from other projects. \r\n\r\ngauge is not important. to adjust the size, add or subtract stitches and/or repeats of the pattern. \r\n\r\ni used a piece of scrap yarn for the drawstring cord for these, but you can use anything you'd like for it. cotton twill, ribbon, or an i-cord would work nicely as well.\r\n\r\nthis is my first pattern i've ever written. it has been test knit only by me. if you notice any major issues, please let me know and i will get the pattern updated. \r\n\r\nif you want to support me, the pattern is available for pay-what-you-want on [ko-fi][1]! \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://ko-fi.com/s/bda9a63f17",
