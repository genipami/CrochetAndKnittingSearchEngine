    "content": "important a few of the wonderful people who used my pattern noted that the eyes and the knights cape came out too big i d recommend using a smaller hook size for the eyes and decrease the amount of row on the knights cape if you run into this problem i ll see if i ll find the time to look over the patterns and fix this ~ happy crocheting this is a pattern to crochet hollow knight plushies the knight and hornet feel free to use any hook size and any kind of yarn that you would like to use i personally used acrylic/cotton yarn and a 3 mm hook my plushies ended up about 12 cm the knight and 15 cm hornet tall"
