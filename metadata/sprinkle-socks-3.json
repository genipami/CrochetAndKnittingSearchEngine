  "notes": "**this pattern was designed as a mystery sock (mock) for the january/february 2026 stranded colorwork challenge in the sock knitters anonymous group on ravelry.**\r\n\r\nthe pattern is divided into a series of four clues to be released on january 1, 8, 15, and 22 of 2026. because it is designed as a mystery, no photos of the socks are present in any of the clues and all project pages should use a spoiler shield as the first photo when knitting along with the kal.\r\n\r\n**materials:**\r\nfingering weight sock yarn in 2 colors.  designer used knit picks hawthorne in colorways burlingame and klamath falls.\r\n•\tcolor 1 (c1) – 50-60 g\r\n•\tcolor 2 (c2) – 40-50 g  \r\n\r\nit’s recommended that one color is solid and the other is solid, semi-solid/tonal, or speckled, and there is good contrast between the yarns with no shared colors. the charts are designed so that color 1 (c1) is lighter in value than color 2 (c2).  yarn amounts are estimates and will vary depending on pattern size, leg, and foot length.  \r\n\r\nus size 1 (2.25 mm) & size 1.5 (2.5 mm) circular needles \r\n•\tor sizes needed for fit - a larger needle (2.5 mm) may be necessary to get gauge in colorwork plus one size smaller for the ribbing, heel, and toe (2.25 mm).\r\n•\tthis pattern is written for magic loop but can be adapted to your preferred needle type – tips for other methods are given in the instructions.  for magic loop, i recommend circular needles of at least 32” to work one sock, but i prefer 40-47”.\r\n\r\nlocking/removable stitch markers (4) & tapestry needle\r\n\r\n**gauge**\r\n8-9 spi (stitches per inch) in 2-color stranded colorwork using larger needles (size 1.5 - 2.5 mm)\r\n* at 9 spi, the sock will be 7.3\" (8\", 8.7”) in circumference.  \r\n* at 8 spi, the sock will be 8.25\" (9\", 9.75”) in circumference.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nthis pattern is offered free, but if you would like to [buy me a cup of coffee][1], i would appreciate it! \r\n\r\n\r\n**follow knittymelissa:**\r\n<small>ravelry: [knittymelissa designs group][2]\r\nyoutube: [https://www.youtube.com/knittymelissa][3]\r\ninstagram: @knittymelissa</small>\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://paypal.me/knittymelissa?country.x=us&locale.x=en_us\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/groups/knittymelissa-designs\r\n  [3]: https://www.youtube.com/knittymelissa"
