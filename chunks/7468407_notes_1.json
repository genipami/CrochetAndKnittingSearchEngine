    "content": "this tee is knitted top down with a placket in the back to make it easier to put on your doll it is knitted flat to the bottom of the placket and then in the round to the hem any fingering weight yarn should work just fine i have used from 18 wpi yarn to 23 wpi you just need 10 -12 yards so this is a good use for those little balls you ve probably been collecting i put the gauge in but i wouldn t worry too much about it at this size it s easier to just start and see if it will fit your doll rather than knit a gauge square tips * sometimes the sleeves will want to flare out a bit especially with a thicker yarn what i normally do in that case is zhuzh them with my fingers sort of pinching them to make them lay down * you can also change to a smaller needle for the sleeve cast-off section only to keep the sleeves from flaring out it s a bit fiddly but works well it gives a slightly puffed-sleeve look * i found several ways to style the tees during a recent 12 items 12 looks instagram challenge see the photo for what i did this pattern is free but if you want to say thank you please create a project page here on ravelry"
