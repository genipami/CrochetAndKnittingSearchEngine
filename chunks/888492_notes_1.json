    "content": "a crochet beanie pattern for men can be so hard to find that s why i designed this simple but richly textured crochet beanie pattern this beanie has 3 sizes baby child and adult but i designed the hat with a simple double_crochet crown to be easily adjusted using the flat circle hat method i ve explained here 1 you ll need less than 250 yds of yarn to complete the hat in any size so this is also an excellent gift or stash busting pattern i m really excited to try it out with some of my luxury yarn stash enjoy 1 https //saltypearlcrochet com/crochet-hat-sizes-flat-circle-method/"
