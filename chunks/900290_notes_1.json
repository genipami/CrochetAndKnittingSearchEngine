    "content": "this is a fast little hat that looks adorable on any new pixies that show up in your family the ringwood stitch which is used in this pattern is easy to knit warm and cozy and repetitive enough that this project is easy tv knitting and makes a great first hat project for those newer to the craft as an additional benefit this stitch has a fair bit of stretch which will give a few extra months wear to the hat great for when a northern winter also stretches on a few extra months this pattern is written with notes on how to change the stitch count so if you want to make additional sizes for the rest of the family or knit the hat in a different weight of yarn it is a pretty easy calculation to make meterage noted in pattern is for a newborn/baby size scale up accordingly enjoy"
