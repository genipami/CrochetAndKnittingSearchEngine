  "notes": "“the nets were overflowing\r\nin the gulf of mexico”\r\nfrom “refuge of the roads” by joni mitchell\r\n\r\na long skinny scarf with a rustic garter stitch chevron, inspired by a favorite song.\r\nthe scarf is worked with two strands held together. i worked with relatively short lengths of yarn, splicing in a new color when necessary, generally holding a dark and light shade together, sometimes holding two darker colors together.\r\nthe pattern can also be worked in a more varied palette to use up more varied scraps.\r\nknit on 5mm/us8 needles with approximately 60g/280yds/260m of leftover yarns including jamieson’s of shetland spindrift and some merino silk mixes. **if you are working with one strand of a heavier yarn, allow approximately 140yds/130m.**\r\ndimensions:\r\napproximately 4.75ins/12cm wide by 46ins/117cm\r\ngauge: approximately 19sts (measured on the diagonal) and 22 rows (measured along the spine) = 4ins/10cm in pattern",
