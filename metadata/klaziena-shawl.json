  "notes": "this shawl design is dedicated to the memory of klaziena mckinlay swanson (nee greve) — beloved mother of sharon hill of the southside sweeties crochet group, beenleigh bowls club.\r\n\r\nthis is either a triangular or rectangular shawl, alternating mesh/lace work with solid bands. the rectangular repeating pattern can be used for anything from a shawl, pillow/cushion cover, table runner, table cloth, placemat, dresser cover, or as a larger item for across the end of the bed.\r\n\r\nthere are small charts in each row of the written pattern to assist with visualising the order of stitches and the placement of stitches relative to the row below.\r\n\r\n**yarn:**\r\ni suggest kokonki motki ombre. they have a variety of gradient cakes in cotton, cotton acrylic, cotton acrylic shine, soft acrylic, pure merino, and merino. you can even design your own colourway.\r\nthey also have a range of scheepjes and yarnart flowers, which would also be suitable for this project.\r\n\r\navailable online at kokonki.pl. #kokonki #kokonkimotkiombre\r\n\r\n**you can follow me on:** \r\nravelry: https://www.ravelry.com/designers/kirsten-bishop \r\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/lil_psychotic \r\ninstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lil_psychotic73/ \r\npinterest: https://www.pinterest.com.au/kirstenbishop50/ \r\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lilpsychoticdesigner/ \r\nfacebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/kirstenbishopdesigns/\r\n\r\n**tags:**\r\n&#35;lil_psychotic73\r\n&#35;kirstenbishop \r\n&#35;klazienashawl\r\n&#35;klaziena\r\n\r\n**photographs of my original klaziena**\r\nthe photographs of my original klaziena (made using two scheepjes whirl in slice ‘o’ cherry pie) were taken by timothy godinez of a moment of art. styling and background artwork by michaela godinez. you can see more of their work on instagram www.instagram.com/your.moments_photography/ or facebook www.facebook.com/tim.godinez.art/\r\n"
