  "notes": "the triangular pattern is designed to repeat, so you can continue the repeating pattern until the desired size of shawl is achieved. \r\n\r\nthe rectangular repeating pattern can be used for anything from a rectangle shawl, pillow/cushion cover, table runner, table cloth, placemat, dresser cover, or as a larger item for across the end of the bed.\r\n\r\nthis pattern is for beginning to intermediate crocheters.\r\n\r\nthere are small charts in each row of the written pattern to assist with visualising the order of stitches on one side of the shawl and the placement of stitches relative to the row below.\r\n\r\nphotos of each row are also in the document.\r\n\r\npattern alternates between flower lacework and a chain pattern.\r\n\r\nyou can follow me on:\r\ntwitter : https://twitter.com/lil_psychotic\r\ninstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lil_psychotic73/\r\npintrest: https://www.pinterest.com.au/kirstenbishop50/\r\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lilpsychoticdesigner/\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/kirstenbishopdesigns/"
