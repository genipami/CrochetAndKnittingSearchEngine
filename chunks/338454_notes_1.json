    "content": "a very simple stranded pattern could be ideal to use up leftovers as long as you are not afraid to sew in the ends on the inside when i was nearly finished writing up the pattern i noticed that my design came fairly close to this 1 pattern by anna zilboorg the actual repeat is different as well as the construction details but the overall effect is unfortunately similar and that just shows that none of us are re-inventing the wheel here anyone familiar with knitting stranded socks should have no difficulties and it would be fairly easy to convert this to a toe-up construction as always however this has not been test knit so there may be glitches in there if in doubt send me a quick message 1 http //www ravelry com/patterns/library/20---triangles"
