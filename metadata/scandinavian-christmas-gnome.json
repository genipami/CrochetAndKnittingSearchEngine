  "notes": "this paid listing is for the print/ereader friendly version.  you can also visit my blog and get this pattern completely free!\r\n\r\nthe pattern is really very simple, and it’s definitely possible to whip out one or two of these in an evening.  they make great ornaments, or you could even attach a loop to the top of the hat and hang it in your tree.\r\n\r\nso, what will you need?  a couple of shades of red, a grey, a brown, white and off-white mini catona skeins, and rice!  we’re going fill the bodies with rice, so a little tip: if you crochet loosely, consider using a stocking as a lining, or size your hook down.  the pattern uses a 3mm hook, but you might consider a 2.5mm.\r\n\r\nif you were to use one colour alone, you'd use less than one mini catona skein.  so, if you get a couple of balls of each colour, you'll be able to make an entire family!\r\n\r\nmerry christmas"
