  "notes": "knitted knockers are special handmade breast prostheses for women who have undergone mastectomies or other procedures to the breast. traditional breast prostheses can be expensive, heavy, sweaty and uncomfortable. they typically require special bras or camisoles with pockets and can’t be worn for weeks after surgery. knitted knockers on the other hand are soft, comfortable, beautiful and when placed in a regular bra they take the shape and feel of a real breast.\r\n\r\nknitted knockers are made by caring volunteers and always given away free.  please do not use this pattern to sell them. these patterns have been developed, tested and are based on feedback from numerous knitted knocker recipients. if you modify these patterns and reprint them, please include a reference and/or link back to these original patterns. \r\n\r\nvisit www.knittedknockers.org (the one with the pink ribbon logo on it) to learn more about how to help make knockers for others. register as a knitter/crocheter and we will help you to share your wonderful gifts of comfort and dignity.\r\n\r\nother tips:\r\nonly light neutral colors on the front (top) please. light neutral colors are the top request.\r\n\r\n•\twe define light neutral as the entire front of the knocker shades of white, cream, beige, or sand. \r\n•\tdark neutral colors are defined as shades of brown or black.\r\n•\tpastel/bright is defined as any color outside of those listed above. knockers made with colored nipples will be given out in this category even if main color is neutral.. \r\n\r\nmost of our requests are for pairs of light neutral colors. unless you are working up a specially requested knocker, we ask that you work all knockers in a light or dark neutral. brighter colors can be added on the bottom with color changing to the light neutral at least 2 rows before transitioning to the top section so the color doesn't peek out when worn.\r\n\r\nfor info on what to do with your creations visit knittedknockers.org.\r\n\r\nfor international instructions, [click here][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.knittedknockers.org/international-patterns/"
