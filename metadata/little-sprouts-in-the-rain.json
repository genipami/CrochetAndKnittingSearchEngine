  "notes": "this pattern is written for self-striping yarn. however, you can stripe your own yarns as well if desired. could also be great for scraps and minis.\r\n\r\npattern can be worked either toe up or cuff down. if done toe up, i think the slipped stitches look like little sprouts. if done cuff down, they look like little droplets of rain. \r\n\r\nthis has a cute mini rolled edging at the cuff. and a fun garter stitch short row (shadow wrap) heel. \r\n\r\nthis pattern also has my signature mini wedge gusset that is also in my [up & down vanilla swirl][1] pattern and my [horseshoe falls][2] pattern, which is helpful for those who have a high instep, but like a short row heel. \r\n\r\n6 sizes available\r\n\r\neasily adjustable!\r\n\r\ni have discovered that if i use contrasting yarn (leftovers or minis or whatever) for heels, toes, and cuffs, i can usually get two pairs of adult medium sized socks out of one skein.\r\n\r\npattern has not been officially tested. so if you have any questions or problems, don't hesitate to let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/up--down-vanilla-swirl\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/horseshoe-falls",
