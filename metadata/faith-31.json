(similar to 4-ply whirls/twirls)\r\n\r\naran – worsted – #4 weight – 10-ply – approx. 4704 metres –  5144 yards – \r\n5 mm h hook. finished size  178 cm / 70 inches.\r\n\r\nhow much yarn you need depends on how many colours you chose to use.\r\nplease see the details of the yarn packs in the [introducing faith][3] post on my website to give you an idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://crystalsandcrochet.com/product-category/crochet-a-long/faith/\r\n  [2]: https://www.facebook.com/groups/helenshookaholics\r\n  [3]: https://crystalsandcrochet.com/product-category/crochet-a-long/faith/"
