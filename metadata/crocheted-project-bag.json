  "notes": "learn to crochet by whipping up a beginner-friendly crocheted project bag! i designed this bag after finding some unloved cotton yarn in my stash and deciding to make something with it that was simple but very usable.\r\n\r\nour free pattern comes with an accompanying step-by-step video tutorial to walk you though everything you need to know. if you’re new to crochet don’t worry, the project only requires a few easy stitches. once it’s finished, you can use your new crocheted project bag to store whatever other small crafts you’re working on!
