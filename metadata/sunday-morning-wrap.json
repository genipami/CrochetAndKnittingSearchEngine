  "notes": "> espace tricot is a yarn store in montreal, canada. [discover our yarns here!][1]\r\n\r\nour sunday morning dk yarn is a deliciously rustic yet soft blend of bluefaced leicester and masham fibres spun and dyed in england. the unique blend of naturally brown and off-white fibres creates a heathered effect which brings depth and dimension.\r\n\r\nas a nod to the coziness and slower pace of sunday mornings, our sunday morning wrap is a relaxing, lightly textured design worked in alternate sections of stockinette and twisted rib. in the shape of an inverted isosceles trapezoid, the elongated shape is perfect both as a light wrap and a cozy scarf, and makes for a perfectly gender neutral accessory.\r\n\r\nsample shown in the colourway offline\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.espacetricot.com"
