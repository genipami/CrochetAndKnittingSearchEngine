    "content": "i designed this hat to use some beautiful hand-dyed yarn made by the yarn store in my parents hometown of ely minnesota the cable pattern in the hat comes from cailyn meyer s logi scarf https //www ravelry com/patterns/library/logi-2 1 her pattern and mine are shared freely under the creative commons attribution - noncommercial-share alike 3 0 united states license norway pine trees more commonly known as red pine trees are abundant in ely i choose the name norway pine for the hat to acknowledge ely and the source of the yarn as well as the norse myth that cailyn used to name the logi pattern materials yarn about 200-225 yds 185-205 m of worsted weight yarn i used sisu hand dye worsted from sisu designs https //sisudesigns org/ 2 this is a lighter worsted weight 218 yds/200 m per 100 g malabrigo rios or knit picks wool of the andes would be a good substitute or pretty much any worsted weight yarn if you are worried about running out of yarn you can opt for a single brim needles size us 7 4 5 mm needles or whatever size is needed to make gauge 16-inch circulars and double pointed needles or your preferred method of medium and small circumference knitting in the round size us 5 3 75 mm needles or 1-2 sizes smaller than your main needles 16-inch circulars for knitting the brim ribbing gauge about 24 stitches and 32 row in 4 inches by 4 inches 10cm by 10cm of moss stitch using the larger needles i used us 6 needles but i usually have to use smaller needles so i m guessing that us 7 will work for most people sizing this hat fits my 22-inch 56 cm head quite nicely due to the stretch of the cables and moss stitch i think it would fit about 20-24 inches 51-61 cm to adjust the size you could change the gauge change the length the ribbing or add or subtract multiples of 4 stitches from the moss stitch panels some knitters are finding this hat a little large the last picture is a variation on the version 2 chart that has a cast on of 96 st instead of 112 for snugger ribbing and also takes 8 rounds off of the top in case your hat is getting too long two versions there are two versions of the hat/chart version 1 shown in green has more moss stitch and 3 cable panels version 2 shown in orange has less moss stitch and 4 cable panels the fit is similar 1 https //www ravelry com/patterns/library/logi-2 2 https //sisudesigns org/"
