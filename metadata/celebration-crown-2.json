  "notes": "knit crowns add fun and whimsy to any event. wear them for birthdays, holidays, game nights and any celebration. i’ve noticed that kids are extra silly when wearing these crowns!\r\n\r\nthe celebration is a very quick knit and can be completed with just roughly 50 yards of worsted weight yarn.\r\n\r\nsizing can be easily customised. knit the crown pattern until the piece fits snugly across your forehead. then cast off and seam together.\r\n\r\nwatch the [free tutorial video][1] for a step-by-step guide on how to knit theses crowns.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://youtu.be/pbfypyvutxq"
