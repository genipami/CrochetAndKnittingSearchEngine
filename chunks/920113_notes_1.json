    "content": "this is a fun project that includes patterns for 5 different cactus/succulent plants as well as the soil and the pot you can follow the pattern as it is or you can make up the plants individually and glue them into plastic or terracotta pots instead apart from the yarn you will need some polyester fill to stuff four of the five plants plus the pot this project would also work well with cotton/cotton blend yarns like 4 seasons brighton cotton blend or 4 seasons flinders cotton using the appropriate hook for the yarn gauge is not crucial to this project but it is recommended to use the suggested hook size for the yarn or slightly smaller to prevent the stuffing from migrating through the stitches"
