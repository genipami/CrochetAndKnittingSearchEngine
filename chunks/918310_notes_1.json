    "content": "the litmus cowl is a basic recipe for creating a fun striped cowl it s something i improvised to work on while i was travelling and i got so many questions about it i thought i d write up what i did i knit mine using a mini skein kit from canon hand dyes and a skein of undyed merino yak nylon but it s perfect for using up leftover fingering weight yarn i used 24 5g mini skeins for the contrast colours and one full skein of the undyed yarn as the main colour the finished measurements when grafted together are 75cm long by 18cm wide - it s perfect to wear wrapped twice gauge isn t super important with this pattern - just knit to the length you re happy with before you graft the ends together"
