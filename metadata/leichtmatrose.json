  "notes": "this is **sweater for beginners** (or advanced knitters who are looking for a relaxing tv knit) and will be **free** forever (or as long as ravelry exists).\r\n\r\n“leichtmatrose“ is an untrained sailor in german.\r\nthe sweater ist worked down, basically with raglan increases, but with a little twist to shape a rounded front neck:\r\non the front side, the raglan increases are worked less often, and every 16 rounds, they are complemented by a set of radial yoke increases.\r\n*(i call this method „sirayo“, which stands for “simple raglan with yoke (increases)“.)* \r\n\r\n**difficulty level:** * out of *****\r\nneeded skills\r\n•\tknit stitches, purl stitches (not too many of them)\r\n•\tincreases in 2 directions: left-leaning (m1l) and right-leaning (m1r).\r\n•\tdecreases in 2 directions: right-leaning (k2tog ) and left-leaning (ssk).\r\nno short rows, no picking up stitches from edges (except a few underarm stitches), and absolutely no sewing!\r\n\r\n**needles & gauge** \r\nmain needle size is **3,5mm** (or needle size to obtain gauge). 3,0mm for ribbings at neck, hem and cuff.\r\n**gauge: 24 sts x 34 rows** in stockinette after blocking. approx. 1000/ 1100/ 1200/ 1300/ 1400 m of a sport weight yarn needed (with approx. 50m more of color c1 than of c2 for the edgings). 4 stitch markers required.\r\n\r\n**yarn**\r\nany sport weight yarn (or fingering weight, if you are a loose knitter) that knits up to the specific gauge.\r\nfor my sample, i have used the beautiful hand-dyed [färbebengel poppenbüttel][1] (75% merino, 25% silk, 266m/ 100g) in colors c1 = “blauer panther” and c2 = “gorgonzola” in 2-row stripes.\r\nbut you could as well use up odd skeins and leftovers and configure your own stripes.\r\n\r\n**errata:\r\nstep 1: upper body \r\nstep 1.1 neck edge (ne)**\r\nwork **5** rounds in ribbing, either \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://shop.faerbebengel.de/produkt-kategorie/dk/poppenbuettel-dk/"
