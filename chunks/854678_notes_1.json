    "content": "this blanket was designed with alzheimer s patients and other persons suffering from any cognitive disability in mind it uses a lot of notions and though oyu might think it is cost intensive it is not most of the notions are things you probably have around your home that you no longer use plus this blanket is easy to customise with the supplies you already have- you only need to let your imagination free rein it is made in 6 blocks which are then seamed together all blocks have some form of notion or the other so there will be a lot of sewing you will need less than 500 yards of yarn to make all 6 blocks"
