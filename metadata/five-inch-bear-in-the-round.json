  "notes": "this bear is knit in the round from the top down. sleeves are created by increasing at each of the arms and then placing stitches on waste yarn once they total 12 stitches. then the body is knit in the round proceeding to the lower torso (or pants) which splits to form two legs. held stitches are placed back on needles and knit in the round for arms and paws. finishing includes stuffing, cinching legs and arms, and embroidering a face. \r\n\r\ndirections include stitch and round counts as well as length in inches for each segment of the bear so makers can adjust to a maximum total of 5” for bear length. your gauge might vary so use the round counts as a suggestion. for bears with limb difference (i.e. amputee bears), make one arm or leg shorter.\r\n\r\n**material needed**\r\ndk or worsted (heavier worsted yarn will make a wider bear and require fewer rows). a few yards for head, shirt, pants, feet, and paws\r\n"
