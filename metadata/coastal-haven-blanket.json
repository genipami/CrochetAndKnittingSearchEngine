  "notes": "the coastal haven blanket is a free crochet pattern on my blog!\r\n\r\nthis square blanket is worked from the center-out as a square working rounds of simple, beginner-friendly stitches to size desired.  i used an ombre self-striping yarn with short color changes to create the woven look.\r\n\r\nwhat makes the stitch so unique looking is that you are working a round of double crochets with skipped stitches and then the next round you are “dropping” your double crochet stitches into those skipped stitches – either in front of or behind the ch-1 space created from the previous row. i have a complete photo and video tutorial for this stitch which will help you crochet this blanket. link to stitch tutorial provided!\r\n\r\neasy to customize to size - just continue working rounds to size desired!"
