    "content": "simple cable hat miles riley october 2015 needles one set of double pointed needles for the main body of the hat i used us #7 s use whatever you re comfortable with and gives you a gauge you re happy with one set of slightly smaller double pointed needles for the ribbing at the brim and finishing the decreasing on top i used a us #5 but it doesn t matter too much what size you use as long as they re a little smaller one significantly larger needle for casting on i used a us #10 5 alternately you could use two of your double pointed needles held together yarn i used jo sharp classic dk wool for this project but any dk weight should be fine if you have sensitive skin you would probably want to go with something much softer than regular 100% wool you might be able to just squeak by with one ball of yarn for the small but i d recommend two to be on the safe side and for the larger sizes gauge i would recommend knitting a test swatch of one pattern repeat with at least a little extra fabric on each side the 12 stitch pattern segment should measure about 1 \u00bd inches across unstretched and about 2 inches gently stretched to get the hat sizes small 20 inch medium 22 inch and large 24 inch with that said this is a one size fits most type of pattern so chances are you ll be all right if you d prefer to just start right in instructions brim cast on 120 132 144 st on your us #10 5 needle using the long tail cast on method in knit 2 purl 2 rib you ll need quite a bit of tail maybe four or five yards carefully transfer to us #5 double pointed needles and join for knitting in the round stitches will be very loose when you first transfer i would recommend splitting them over 4 needles but you can get away with using 3 if you re cautious mark the beginning of the round with a stitch marker or piece of yarn and then knit 2 purl 2 rib for 10 row about an inch and a half pre cable round at your start marker switch to your #7 needles optionally you can mark all your pattern repeat segments as you go around you should have 10 11 12 pattern segments of 12 stitches each knit 6 purl 2 knit 2 purl 2 *repeat it can be easy to lose track of your pattern at this juncture since you don t yet have the visual of the established cable to guide you remember that the only thing you re doing differently in this round from the k2 p2 pattern of the round before is that the first k2 p2 k2 of your 12 stitch segment has become k6 the two purl stitches in the middle are now being knit"
