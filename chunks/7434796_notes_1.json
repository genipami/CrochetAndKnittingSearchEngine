    "content": "**materials needed** 1 skein of light weight yarn 3 4mm hook scissors tapestry needle this pattern is beginner friendly as it focuses on two stitches the combine together to make this beautiful bandana some helpful tips when working with this pattern are that 1 i used loops & threads soft ombre blush/sky blue/mint yarn for this project 2 if the middle of row 1 becomes too loose pull the tail to tighten 3 make sure your gauge is not too tight when doing the straps or it will be a pain in the butt to crochet into i hope you enjoy the pattern as much as i do"
