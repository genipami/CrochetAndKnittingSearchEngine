    "content": "gauge in pattern using j-10 6 mm hook 7 clusters and 5 row = 4 /10 cm this wrap is worked on a bias stitches are deducted at the beginning and added at the end the short ends of the wrap are not straight across they are at a diagonal the stitch pattern itself is rather complex however once you add the shaping of the ends it gets even more complex for this reason i have provided additional notes in the comments and will continue to do so as notes and emails come to me from individuals working on this pattern if you have additional comments please feel free to message me or write additional comments thank you **tip** if you would like to try out a swatch of this design please note that you ll need a multiple of 12 plus 8 i used a foundation chain of 32 in order to test the pattern when you are working this stitch pattern because of the bias it is very easy to miss the last stitch please put a stitch marker or small piece of contrasting yarn on each beginning single_crochet this way when you come back around you ll know exactly where the final single_crochet is located trust me it s hard to see **note** although in the grand scheme of things it won t matter all that much please note that a chain 1 at the beginning of every row 2 works better than a chain 3 >note from designer this pattern is no longer available on the caron website i have been given written permission to post the pdfs of my free caron patterns on ravelry"
