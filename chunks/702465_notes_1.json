    "content": "warm yummy texture is paired with classic cables and my most favorite ribbing to hug close wear the cuffs folded up or down over leggings and your favorite boots pair with a thick wool yarn and you won t ever know it s cold when you go outside this pattern is easy to customize in length while the finished length is stated knitters can shorten or lengthen their leg warmers by decreasing or increasing the amount of body repetitions they complete each repetition adds about an inch of length to the leg warmer example if you would like decrease the length by an inch do 12 repetitions of the body pattern instead of 13 the pattern hugs close so if you are on the fence about size i d recommend going up to the next especially if you know you ll pair it over other layers please note that the amount of yarn you will use will vary depending on the needle size and weight testers of this pattern found they used more yarn by going up in needle size and / or using a worsted weight instead of an aran weight yarn please follow me on instagram 1 and facebook 2 or visit my website 3 for wolf & faun knits updates and special offers 1 http //www instagram com/wolfandfaunknits 2 http //www facebook com/wolfandfaunknits 3 http //wolfandfaun com"
