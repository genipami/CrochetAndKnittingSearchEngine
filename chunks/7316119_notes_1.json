    "content": "this is an easy pattern with a repeat of only 2 row wear it as a top or a skirt looks great both ways it is crocheted sideways in 2 flat pieces and then the side seams need to be sewed together the drawstring is a must for this pattern because it will keep the top/skirt secure and prevent it from falling down if you will be wearing the top as a skirt the waist will be slightly big the measurements go by your chest so for example if you crochet the 34 chest size the waist for the skirt will also be 34 it looks nice either way because the drawstring will fix that issue since the top is worked sideways the beginning chain is the starting length which is measured from under your arm by your armpit the beginning length is the same for all sizes which is about 11 inches you will be increasing 1 stitch every row so as you crochet it will get longer the larger your chest size the longer it will get the pattern uses basic crochet terminology and if you have experience with reading a written pattern this is a great pattern for a beginner *it is written english american directions only*"
