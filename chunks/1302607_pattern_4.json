    "content": "that go 2 stitches across place where you want your line to start and 1 up i recommend doing these in a single backstitch because there is no good place to 3 insert your needle from back to front again stop in the middle where you want your line to go next \u25ca finally embroidering over knitting isn t an 4 insert your needle from front to back in the exact science don t be afraid to deviate from same place as in step 1 in order to fill in the what i ve charted if you think something else missing section of line looks better repeat steps 3 and 4 until your line is complete seaming before you start seaming weave in your loose ends however for embroidered lines that finish at the end of one panel and join with a line on another panel you may want to leave the ends loose in case they dont line up and you want to adjust them when seaming along the side of a panel insert your needle between the first and second stitches from the edge this will give you a nice stable seam this sweater was charted with an extra stitch on each side so you will not lose any of the basically step 2 involves sewing the red parts image together hope that s clear enough berroco has a much better explanation of how to seam than i can make https //youtu collar be/4rv3vuuof3s if you would prefer text and photos here s a note as mentioned before i have changed good rundown of seaming techniques https // the chart since knitting my sweater so that brooklyntweed com/pages/seaming-101 the neck hole is smaller if you re looking at my photos thinking gee that neck hole my attempt to explain how to seam this is way too big fear not it s been fixed however this change is untested just so sweater you know 1 line up the top edges of your front and back panels and seam them end-to-end pick up approximately 96 stitches evenly around 2 line up your sleeves inside the shoulders and the neck hole starting from the middle of the sew the top edge of the sleeves into the arm back panel place bor marker holes this is the hardest part of the seaming process i recommend the liberal use of safety it s ok if your count is off by a couple of stitches pins before you start sewing to make sure just make sure it s an even number pick up 1 everything lines up i also recommend starting stitch for each horizontal stitch and 3 stitches for from the middle and working to one end then every 4 vertical stitches for diagonal sections returning to the middle and working to the wave your hands and sob hysterically idk i hate other end you can still complete the seam doing this too just do your best you should have with one single"
