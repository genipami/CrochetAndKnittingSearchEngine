    "content": "10 you have about half of the sts worked on your back needle and half to be worked placing of st markers we want to put st markers on each side of the 33 central sts of needle 2 there is a little math involved in order to center the sole sts here s the math equation to do this take the total number of sts of needle 2 only both worked sts plus those that have to be worked subtract 33 from this number and then divide that number by 2 for example i had 64 sts on my back needle when i subtracted 33 i had 31 left which i then divided by 2 to get 15 \u00bd since i don t have \u00bd a st i counted 16 stitches put a marker counted 33 sts put a second marker and then i had 15 stiches left on the other side of marker 16+33+15=64sts if you have an extra st like me put it on the right side of the right marker and this extra st will be decreased by replacing a p1 with a p2tog at this point i thread a different colored yarn where i want my markers and replace the thread by a marker when i get to those sts needle 2 now that that the markers are in place you have to finish knitting the heel turn sts so knit to first marker sm ssk and then use the gusset ribbing chart to set up your gusset pattern count the number of sts left on your needle i had 13 out of my original 15 since i used 2 to do a ssk use top numbers of the gusset ribbing chart to set up the ribbing pattern i had 13 sts so working the chart from right to left and using the top numbers i worked the chart sts in the following order 13 12 11\u2026 up to 1 in other words the last stitch of needle 2 is stitch number 1 of the top numbers so if you have for example 14 sts left after doing ssk start at st 14 and work your way down up to st 1 gusset ribbing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 32 31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 needle 1 continue in established as per leg/foot chart pattern needle 2 start the gusset ribbing pattern on the other side as follows use the bottom number of the gusset ribbing chart if you had an extra stitch start the gusset ribbing with a p2tog instead of p1 which counts as the first stitch of the chart if you did not have an extra stitch then work"
