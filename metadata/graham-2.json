  "notes": "this is a simple slouch hat made for my son, and using a broken rib stitch.  the hat is completely reversible and the crown decreases are worked seamlessly within the pattern.\r\n\r\nit's a fun quick knit that's perfect for last minute gifts.  enjoy!\r\n\r\n**thank you so much to [arkaitz][1] for translating graham into spanish! \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/people/zitakar"
