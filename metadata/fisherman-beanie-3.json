  "notes": "the fisherman beanie is my all time favorite crochet beanie pattern. i first launched this pattern as a shop item in my wool intentions etsy shop, where it’s been a best seller for years, as it’s a simple yet classic beanie that looks great on everyone. \r\n\r\nthis pattern is worked back and forth in rows, then seamed with a slip stitch seam. one end will then be cinched and closed.\r\n\r\nyarn: quince & co. lark (134 yards), two skeins. the color pictured is caspian. while i recommend quince & co. lark for this pattern, most worsted weight - category 4 yarns should work nicely. 268 yards will be needed. \r\n\r\nhook: us h / 5mm\r\n\r\nnote: gauge is important for this pattern. the stitch pattern used creates a fabric that is stretchy and fits an average head size of 18-23\". a looser tension will result in a hat that is larger than this size. a tighter tension will create a smaller hat. take a moment to make a gauge swatch and adjust your hook size if necessary. when measuring your gauge make sure to measure it when your crochet fabric is un-stretched. \r\n\r\nsharing your work online? please tag @woolintentions, #woolintentions, #fishermanbeanie. i'd love to see your work!",
