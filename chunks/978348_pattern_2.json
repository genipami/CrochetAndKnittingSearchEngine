    "content": "loosely finishing when sewing pieces together i recommend using something like the mattress stitch so the co edges of the legs and mouth don t show fold the bobble edge of the mouth over itself so the purl side faces out sew this edge down then attach co edge of mouth to head the top edge of the mouth should line up with the center of the face sew up gaps between claws and attach legs to body there should be a gap 4 sts wide on the belly between the legs on each side sew in all loose ends now you can add sequins beads embroidery or anything you want to give the water bear some more personality"
