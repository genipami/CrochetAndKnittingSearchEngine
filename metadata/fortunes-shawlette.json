  "notes": "fortune’s shawlette was inspired by the ubiquitous corner to corner stitch, aka the diagonal box stitch. but of course i had to add my own twist to the idea, creating a lacier, more open, summer ready stitch pattern.\nthe result is gorgeous, and just right for year round - bunch it up for warmth, stretch it out for a light as air layer on the shoulders. if you want a bigger shawl, you could try a thicker yarn, or even use the same yarn and add more rows - it’s super easy, and once you get started, it’ll fly off the hook! \n\n this pattern is available for free on mooglyblog.com, or you can purchase the pdf here on ravelry! \r\n\r\nfortune's shawlette was inspired by the ubiquitous corner to corner stitch, aka the diagonal box stitch. but of course i had to add my own twist to the idea, creating a lacier, more open, summer ready stitch pattern. \r\n\r\nthe result is gorgeous, and just right for year round - bunch it up for warmth, stretch it out for a light as air layer on the shoulders. if you want a bigger shawl, you could try a thicker yarn, or even use the same yarn and add more rows - it's super easy, and once you get started, it'll fly off the hook!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
