    "content": "this lightsaber looks a little complicated but works up quick and in one piece pictures are included to help with each step this is for intermediate crocheters it uses back post single_crochet and invisible finishes you can easily add more row to the handle or the blade for a longer piece as written the finished product is about 9 inches long you will need grey and black yarn plus a scrap of red for the handle and whichever colour you d like your blade to be"
