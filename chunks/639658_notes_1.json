    "content": "here s my contribution to the many fantastic crochet octopus patterns out there this pattern is worked in one piece from the top of the head down to the base then legs are added one at a time in the round and lastly the bottom is closed after stuffing optional eyes can be added as a separate piece hopefully my instructions are ok - feel free to ask if they don t make sense either here on rav or on my little blog where the pattern is gauge is not important just use an appropriate hook size for your yarn so the stitches are tight for amigurumi not sure about the yardage but it doesn t take much to make one octopus hook size is not super important either i ve noticed in my own collection of hooks that anywhere from 3 75 to 4 25 can be listed as the same letter size so just use whatever you have i used googly eyes inside a little crocheted casing but any type of eyes will do you can also embellish all the little arms with sewn on sequins and beads i ve used a solid colored cotton yarn but this is a great stash buster for whatever scraps you might have"
