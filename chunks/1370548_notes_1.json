    "content": "this elegant little dress for calico critter and sylvanian family mothers is knitted in one piece top down with no seams it is knitted flat until it is joined in the round under the critter s tail some thoughts on yarns and gauge any fingering weight yarn should work just fine to knit this dress you only need 14-17 yards so this is a good use for those little balls you ve probably been collecting having said that fingering yarns seem to vary quite a bit in weight here are the yardages of some popular fingering and light fingering yarns from heavier to lighter knit picks palette 50 grams = 231 yards red heart baby 50 grams = 280 yards brown sheep nature spun 50 grams = 310 yards i listed my gauge but i wouldn t worry too much about doing a test square there are a couple of easy ways to check your gauge when knitting this pattern for these little critters and especially since they are not all exactly the same size it s easier to just start and see if it will fit your critter rather than knit a gauge square since it s knitted top down you can try the dress on your doll as soon as the armholes are in and then get a really good idea of how it will fit once you join it in the round under the tail this is a good time to check the fit for length too also i have put in the measurement that i got at the end of round 3 if your measurement is much shorter or longer than stated on the pattern you might want to go up or down a needle size you might also need to add extra row in length if you are using a thinner yarn most of my test garments were knitted with knit picks palette one of the thicker fingering yarns but i did use brown sheep nature spun one of the thinner fingering yarns on three of the dressesto compare please look at the photos and read the captions for further information on gauge and needle size finally these dresses are quick to knit i suggest you consider your first one your gauge sample and adjust the needle size and number of rounds before the hem trim depending on how it fits your critter this pattern is free but if you want to say thank you please create a project page here on ravelry"
