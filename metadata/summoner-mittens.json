  "notes": "i knew i wanted to make this pattern free from the very start. it's inspired by the book cover for shadow & bones by leigh bardugo. i'm a huge fan of fantasy, and all i want is to share that love with others. so enjoy this pattern, and if you haven't read the book yet you should give it a try.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nthese mittens are knitted from the cuff, starting with a twisted rib, followed by a latvian braid, and then the two color pattern starts.\r\n\r\nthere are increases for the thumb gusset in order to make them fit the hand better.\r\n\r\nthe thumb is a knit in thumb. the pattern includes a link to a video tutorial.\r\n\r\nneedles: 2.5 mm / us 1.5 circular or double pointed needles (dpns)\r\ngauge: 32 stitches x 36 rows (10x10 cm / 4x4 in blocked) \r\n\r\nyarn: fingering or sport weight wool yarn\r\n(i often use järbo 2 tr ull for mittens)\r\nmain color (mc): 200 meters / 219 yards\r\ncontrast color (cc): 100 meters / 109 yards\r\n\r\nknitting with gauge according to pattern will give you a pair of mittens of the follow measuments:\r\ncircumference: 21 cm / 8.3 in\r\nlength: 26 cm / 10.2 in\r\n\r\nyou can easily change the size by going up or down a needle size or using a thicker or thinner yarn. note that changing needles or thickness of yarn may change amount of yarn needed.\r\n\r\ni recommend meeting the following stitch gauges on 10cm / 4 in for larger mittens:\r\n22 cm / 8.7 in circumference: 31 stitches\r\n24 cm / 9.5 in circumference: 28 stitches\r\n26 cm / 10.2 in circumference: 26 stitches\r\n",
