  "notes": "lately, my knitting has been inspired by one of my other favorite hobbies...baking! in part 4 of this mystery kal, i will share a recipe for my favorite lemon drizzle cake.\r\n\r\nthese mittens will be a mystery kal hosted in the [i make mittens](/groups/i-make-mittens) group during november 2024. parts will be released on:\r\n\r\nnovember 1 - part 1\r\nnovember 8 - part 2\r\nnovember 15 - part 3\r\nnovember 22 - part 4\r\n\r\nthis pattern is fairly easy to adapt for size/density. as written, the mitten knits up as a typical knit fabric. if you like a denser mitten, try a worsted weight yarn knit to the same gauge. you could also use worsted weight yarn with a slightly larger needle to knit at a larger gauge for an even larger size.\r\n\r\n**yarn requirements:**\r\ndk weight yarn - between 150-200 yds \r\n\r\n*sample mittens knit with jaeger matchmaker merino dk, which is sadly discontinued. this yarn came with 130 yds/50 gms; 2 balls were necessary to knit a pair, with plenty leftover.*\r\n\r\nas always, use needles that work for you to get the correct gauge."
