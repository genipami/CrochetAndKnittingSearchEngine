  "notes": "a swirling and spinning circular blanket, very quick to work up, a simple repeating pattern that increases as you go. you can make it to any size, from a cushion cover right up to a big bedspread: just keep following the repeating pattern. \r\n\r\n* for a blanket approximately 48”/122 cm in diameter, you will need three balls of batik swirl. i used the shade purple mist.\r\n* i used a 4.5mm hook. \r\n* after three rounds, my blanket measures 3\"/7.6cm across. however, because this is a repeating pattern, matching gauge is not essential. simply work until your blanket is the size you want. \r\n* you will also need a tapestry needle for sewing in ends.\r\n* you may find stitch markers helpful.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is written in us terms and includes a chart of the first twelve rounds to help get you started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
