  "notes": "**pattern description:** one of my favorite places in tennessee is the flynn creek holler, a narrow valley between rolling hills in south-central jackson county. winter mornings in flynn creek are misty and cold, the perfect weather for throwing on a pair of mittens and taking a quiet walk along the creek. these worsted-weight mittens are textured without being fussy. use a non-superwash wool to showcase the basketweave pattern and stay toasty warm.\r\n\r\n**size:** one size to fit an adult medium hand. finished wrist circumference is 6.5” (16 cm) and hand circumference of 7” (17.5 cm). these mittens stretch around the wearer to fit wrist sizes of 6.5 to 8” (16 to 20 cm) and hand sizes of 7 to 8.5” (17.5 to 21 cm).\r\n\r\n**gauge:** 18 sts and 30 rnds = 4” (10 cm) in stockinette stitch. \r\n\r\n**yarn:** heavy dk or worsted weight wool, approximately 100 g / 210 yds / 192 m.\r\n\r\n**suggested yarn:** the samples shown are knit in blue sky fibers woolstok worsted in colorway grey harbor (grey), junction fiber mill making tracks dk in colorway winterberry (green and pink), and brooklyn tweed shelter in colorway long johns (red).\r\n\r\nsample 1 - blue sky fibers woolstok worsted (50 g / 123 yds / 112 m), 2 skeins\r\n\r\nsample 2 - junction fiber mill making tracks dk (100 g / 210 yds / 192 m), 1 skein\r\n\r\nsample 3 - brooklyn tweed shelter (50 g / 140 yds / 128 m), 2 skeins (discontinued)\r\n\r\n**needles:** us size 5 (3.75 mm) and us size 7 (4.5 mm) needles for small circumference knitting (dpns or magic loop). adjust needle size as necessary to obtain gauge.\r\n\r\n**notions:** stitch markers, stitch holders or scrap yarn, scissors, tapestry needle, and row counter (optional). \r\n",
