    "content": "simple zigzag colourwork reminds me of the rickrack in my mother s sewing kit and a squishy textured pattern makes for a forgiving fit the pattern assumes familiarity with stranded colourwork and basic cuff-down sock construction techniques the colourwork pattern is currently provided only in charted form while beginner colourwork instructions are not provided the pattern includes only short floats and would be suitable for newer colourwork knitters you ll want to have 100 g of your main colour available as well as 20 g of your contrast colour four sizes are included small 56 stitch cuff to fit approximately 7 inch foot medium 64 stitch cuff to fit approximately 8 inch foot large 72 stitch cuff to fit approximately 9 inch foot extra large 80 stitch cuff to fit approximately 10 inch foot these fit just a bit tighter than a stockinette sock with the same stitch count since you adjust your gauge for the colourwork portions thanks very much to crescendogal mammakats sabine yarnoverkd bookworm33329 jeanamaria mycupofknitting 4jewels4 3rdageknitter malyma04 mfour2884 and nevolik for testing"
