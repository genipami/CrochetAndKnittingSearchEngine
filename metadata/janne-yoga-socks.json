  "notes": "janne yoga socks are a dk weight yoga sock pattern. the special thing about yoga socks is the fact that they don’t have a heel or tip. this allows you to have a good grip to your yoga mat while still having warm feet. another benefit is that having no heel or tip makes yoga socks the perfect project for beginner knitters. \r\n\r\n**size**\r\nthe pattern comes in one size, the length, however, is customizable which makes the pattern suitable for many eu sizes (size 37 - size 42). the pattern is also easily adjustable to a higher stitch count.\r\n\r\n**yarn**\r\nthe pattern suggests to use a dk weight sock yarn or two strands of fingering weight sock yarn.\r\n\r\n**needles**\r\n3.5 mm double pointed needles or circular needles to work the magic loop technique\r\n\r\ngeneral note: as a “one-woman-show” i translated this pattern myself. as a native german grammar mistakes in the english pattern can occur.\r\nif you have any questions or problems, please contact me at quasigerade@web.de - thank you so much for your support!\r\n\r\nhappy knitting!\r\nbella",
