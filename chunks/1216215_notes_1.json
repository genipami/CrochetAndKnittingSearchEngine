    "content": "this is a top down circular yoke pattern based on the sweater worn by jennifer lawrence s character kate dibiasky in the 2021 netflix film don t look up it is obviously a copy and not an original design which is why it is free like the snacks i am not a knitwear designer i wrote the chart for my own personal use and started to knit what is now a size 3 using dk weight yarn sport+lace but when the pattern started to generate interest on instagram i added other sizes not all have been test knitted size 3 used of each yarn held double 800m / 875yd of mc 200m / 220yd of c1 black & 100m / 110yd of c2 pink my advise is to try your yoke on regularly as the gauge of stranded colour work will make a huge difference to the outcome having said that it is possible to size up or size down without having to frog the entire yoke if there is an issue there won t be an issue though you ll be fine i found that my gauge became looser after the stranded colour work so much so that the plain section of the body started to flare out into a slight a-line i wanted my sweater to come straight down from the yoke which is why i have added the four body shaping rounds everyone is different which is why the shaping is optional happy knitting"
