    "content": "here is my technique for knitting two-at-a-time fingerless mitts on one needle i designed them to specifically avoid the following * no picking up stitches * no seams * no second sock or mitt syndrome * minimal finishing once you cast off you just need to weave in your cast on and cast off tails and you re done you only need about 50 grams of worsted weight yarn to make a pair of fingerless mitts which makes them a great stashbuster get creative with your leftover bits and pieces and add in some stripes they are worked on us 6 needles in 3x1 ribbing gauge is not important as the ribbing is very forgiving the small is suitable for teens women and people with smaller hands the large is suitable for adults men and people with larger hands don t be intimidated by two-at-a-time knitting once you get the hang of things it is extremely rewarding i hope you try it"
