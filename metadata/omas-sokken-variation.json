  "notes": "so many of you have enjoyed knitting the original version of this pattern, oma’s sokken and i wanted to share this variation which has been my go-to sock pattern lately! \r\n\r\nthis version has no cuff but is knit in ribbing from the top down and results in a super snug and cozy sock.  this pattern is definitely beginner-friendly or if you're an experienced sock knitter, it's a fun alternate to knitting vanilla socks1\r\n\r\nhappy knitting!",
