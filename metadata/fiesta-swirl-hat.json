  "notes": "the fiesta swirl hat is a free crochet pattern on my blog!\r\n\r\nthis hat is worked sideways as a parallelogram shape which is then folded, seamed, then cinched to close the top. this shape creates the \"swirl\" when the ends are folded together.\r\n\r\nwith bold color transitions provided by self-striping yarn in a repetitive stitch pattern makes this hat easy and fun to make!\r\n\r\neasy to customize to any size simply by adding or subtracting rows!\r\n\r\neasy stitch throughout - a single crochet stitch worked in the back loop only creating textured ridges for a ribbed look! this stitch also creates a stretchy and forgiving fit.\r\n\r\nthe match to the fiesta swirl scarf: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/fiesta-swirl-scarf"
