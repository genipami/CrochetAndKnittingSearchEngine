    "content": "of stitches the reason is that each wire length cut can have differences each person will put a different number of stitches onto the wire to cover it and in each specific leaf there is required slight variations in the row plus for each plant you will make multiple leaves i have given the example number of stitches for a 55cm tall leaf for my snake plant a variegated form i created a total of 5 leaves ranging in size from about 30cm to 55cm in height the centre of each snake plant leaf is worked in 2 strands of 8 ply with a 6mm hook over a folded length of wire which acts as a spine to create the wire spine measure and cut a length of 1mm wire from roll using pliers double the finished length of each leaf the wire length should include a portion of length to be buried in your chosen pot i have found a good leaf height without too much sway in the final leaf to be up to about 50cm which is a wire length of 1 metre i have made previous leaves over this length to 90 cm tall 180cm of wire and the doubled wire is not sturdy enough for the weight for longer leaves i recommend at least 3 thickness of wire to be combined after cutting use the pliers to fold the wire in half in the middle and press the strands together but leave an eye at the top to feed yarn through fold over a small end in each length about 1-2cm and again make at least one eye the end result is an eye at the top and bottom of the wire cut 4 to 5 sections of duck tape the width of the roll and about 1-1 5cm wide using the scissors for this purpose note that scissors can become sticky over time and i use medical alcohol or methylated spirits to wipe clean the blades occasionally wrap the folded wire in 4 to 5 areas along length at least one at each end working the tape at an angle onto the wire try to keep the tape as spread out and flat as possible to limit bumps very important do not twist the wires together unless you are after springs once the wire spine is created you can begin crochet using 2 strands of your chosen 8 ply colour with a 6mm hook make a slip knot leaving a tail of around 15cm and chain onto the wire starting at the base which will be the end with the two lengths of wire not the folded end working onto a wire requires practice but is worth it after about 10 chains onto the wire stop and secure the yarn ends through the eye at the base but do not trim the excess yarn will be used to disguise the eye after securing the end you can now push the chains down the wire"
