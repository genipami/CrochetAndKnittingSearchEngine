    "content": "the bloque stitch blanket is made using the bloque stitch surprising i know which is an interlocking stitch where you work into unworked stitches from previous row this creates a nice thick solid fabric without any holes the staggered texture created by the stitches works really well with self striping yarns the pattern is written for a small baby size blanket but can easily be adjusted to be different sizes it is finished off with a simple single_crochet border a video tutorial for the stitch is also included"
