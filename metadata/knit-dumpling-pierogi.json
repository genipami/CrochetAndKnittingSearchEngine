  "notes": "+[media title][1]\r\n\r\n**construction**\r\nthis knit dumpling is knit seamlessly from the center out, beginning with just 8 stitches and expanding through lifted increases to create a round, flat base. after reaching full width, half of the stitches are worked flat to form the folded picot hem. the remaining live stitches are then grafted together with kitchener stitch to shape the body, with stuffing added as you close the seam. finally, the picot edge is refined with light seaming and a small embroidered crease.\r\n\r\n**finished dimensions**\r\ngauge is not critical for this project, but for reference, the dimensions after stuffing and closing are:\r\nwidth: 9 cm\r\nheight: 4 cm\r\nthickness: approx. 2–3 cm, depending on stuffing\r\n\r\n**skills required**:  working in the round on double-pointed   needles   * working flat   * stitch increases   * yarn overs (yo) and paired decreases (k2tog)   * kitchener stitch\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx2tgzq2fdg"
