  "notes": "materials\r\n* super bulky yarn (i used 2 skeins of wool-ease thick & quick - 106 yds each to fill a 7-foot tree)\r\n* 6.5mm and 3.25mm hook (6.5mm for the yarn & 3.25mm for the beads)\r\n* 12mm wooden beads with 3mm hole (see pattern for link to beads used - 172 for a 24 ft. long garland)\r\n* scissors\r\n* optional: jar opener or deflated balloon\r\n\r\nsizing\r\none skein of super bulky yarn that is about 106 yards long, worked with 1 bead in between each puff stitch (172 beads total), equals about 24.5 feet long. depending on how densely you want your garland laced around your tree, i would recommend 2-3 garlands for a 7-8 foot tree."
