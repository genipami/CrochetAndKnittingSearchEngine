    "content": "the idea for the mitts colour swatch grew out of my need to test how colours go together before knitting a whole garment sure you can make a swatch but i find it boring and feel like a waste of time stupid i know but by knitting something i can use while testing how different colours play together it becomes more motivating it goes relatively quickly and each mitten doesn t have to be exactly the same you can play around with different colours of course it also works well if you just want to use leftover bits of nutiden the pattern includes special techniques such as the latvian braid and provides instructions for how to do them the finished mitts fit a hand with a circumference of ca 19 cm and the fit is quite tight to be shaped by your hand if you want a bigger or smaller mitt you can adjust the size of your needles for my samples i have used various colours of leftovers approximately 1 gram/colour border since nutiden can vary in weight during different production seasons it s difficult to give an exact amount"
