    "content": "this baby jacket is a great way to use up leftover sock yarn and make a fun little sweater at the same time this pattern uses three different leftover yarns one is a solid one is variegated and one is self-striping you can mix yours up however you like i also varied the width of my stripes as i knitted make yours as varied or as regular as you like you don t have to follow the charts provided you can hardly go wrong just make sure that your sock yarns are all the same weight and fiber content more or less using superwash yarn is a good idea to keep this little garment easy-care"
