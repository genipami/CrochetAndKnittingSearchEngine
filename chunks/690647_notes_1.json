    "content": "this cute chemo cap was designed with chemo patients in mind finished hat will be approximately 19 5 unstretched but will fit a head 20 to 22 which is an average adult head if you are making it for someone who has a smaller head with no hair cast on 88 or use a thinner yarn and a us6 needle you will need around 60-70g of worsted weight yarn but i put down a 100g ball just to make sure you don t run out i made this chemo cap pattern free so that it can be made and shared with those in need hopefully it will make a very rough time a little bit better"
