    "content": "these gloves are knit in a 2x2 rib and fit the hand with negative ease perfect for autumn and in a very timeless style they are fast and simple to knit but are most suitable for an intermediate knitter who is able to improvise ribbing during sections of added stitches and who has some familiarity with the construction of gloves the pattern will give you the exact number of stitches increases and inches you need to complete the glove but will not always specify exact knits and purls which are inferred because of the amount of negative ease it is difficult to measure exactly how the gloves will fit the small size was designed to fit a hand that is 7 across the knuckles with fingers that have a 2 circumference while the large size is designed for a hand that is 8 across the knuckles with fingers that have a 3 circumference the small size uses a little more than half a skein while the large takes a little less than a whole skein"
