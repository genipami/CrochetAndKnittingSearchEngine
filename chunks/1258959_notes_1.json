    "content": "the candy kisses blanket is a free crochet pattern on my blog this lacy modern twist on the v_stitch is worked in a two round repeat this pattern has one round of standard v-stitches followed by a round of single_crochet and chain-3 spaces for the next round the v-stitches are then worked in those chain-3 spaces from the previous row this creates a lacy unique stitch with lovely drape this blanket is worked center out as a square so it is very easily customizable just work additional rounds for a larger blanket and fewer rounds for a smaller blanket no need to worry about foundation chain multiples on this one which is one of the great things about a center out square another great thing about this blanket is there is absolutely no need to add a different border by ending on a round of chain-3 spaces you have a simple border edge that is simple yet lovely i have a complete video tutorial available for this blanket as well the ad-free pdf includes a complete stitch diagram if you prefer that over written pattern instructions such a fun project"
