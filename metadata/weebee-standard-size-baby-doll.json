  "notes": "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nnew for september 2020 - separate alternative rounder head pdf now added to ravelry - this head is just a slightly different shape, it is no bigger or smaller and has the same amount of rounds, so all of the hair caps and hats will fit just as in the original version.  if you choose this new version, please let me know what you think so i can decide whether to replace the original head with this one!  thank you x\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n2018 update - the weebee pattern has had a makeover - now bigger and better than ever and, best of all, still free!\r\n\r\nwhat's new?\r\n\r\n• weebee now has a defined thumb on her hand like her cousins nelly and moll moll\r\n\r\n• there are now 2 versions of the arm - one to sew on as before and one to easily crochet on - no sewing required!\r\n\r\n• pattern now includes a faq section.\r\n\r\n• pattern now includes fitting advice for the hair cap.\r\n\r\n• pattern now includes even more helpful photo's, advice and links.\r\n\r\n• pattern now includes optional neck definition and support round.\r\n\r\n• pattern is no longer written in a shorthand style which makes it much more beginner friendly now!\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nthis is the basic naked doll pattern for my standard sized weebee doll which includes short hair cap with links to other options.\r\n\r\nwhen i make my weebee dolls using worsted/4/aran/10ply weight yarn and a 3mm hook or light worsted/3/dk/8ply weight yarn and a 4mm hook, they stand at 8.5 - 9 inches tall.  however, other yarn weights and hooks can of course be used to create smaller or larger dolls. dolls made with worsted weight yarn vary from 12 to 14 inches tall dependant upon yarn brand and hook size.  see advice in the pattern for more info!\r\n\r\nthere are also lots of different clothing patterns for weebee now which are linked to in the pattern.\r\n\r\nall my dolls and clothing patterns can be found [here][1] in my ravelry store.\r\n\r\ndue to the unexpected but wonderful popularity of my weebee dolls and clothing patterns there is now a dedicated facebook group which you can find [here][2].\r\n\r\nweebee is named after my youngest niece phoebe - when she was first born my daughter and phoebe’s older sister couldn’t say her name properly yet and she has been nicknamed ‘weebee’ ever since.\r\n\r\nevery effort has been made to ensure that this pattern is error free but i have very little time to spare (i have a three year old, lol!) so if you find any errors whatsoever in this pattern please do not hesitate to contact me and i will amend as soon as possible.\r\n\r\ni hope you have as much fun crocheting weebee as i and many others have!\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/designers/laura-tegg\r\n  [2]: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1590618731240406/ttp://www.ravelry.com/designers/laura-tegg\r\n  [2]: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1590618731240406/"
