    "content": "this pattern was written when i desperately wanted to knit some gloves with fingers but didn t have the patience or concentration to knit a pair in the round these gloves are knit sideways on 2 straight needles in garter stitch beginning at the little finger working across to the thumb it s a very easy pattern with a few short row for shaping don t worry the short row instructions are very clear and easy to follow - the pattern is so simple that you will find it easy to adjust the length of the fingers and cuff if needed the gloves pictured are knit in noro kureyon sock yarn but they look great in any sock yarn 4-ply fingering weight or baby yarn they knit up pretty fast and they re a good small project to take with you when you re on the go as well because the whole lot needles yarn etc fits easily into your bag you can use up all your little bits of left over yarn as well so it makes a great stash busting project - these gloves look great in variegated or self striping yarn"
