    "content": "i love knitting flowers and the remembrance poppy is my favourite i have knitted hundreds and hundreds for the royal british legion poppy appeal i like to the look of separate petals but find them time consuming to make so i have designed which gives the illusion of petals but is knitted in one piece the centre is knitted separately it is very quick to do alternatively you could use a button gauge is not important for this pattern you can change the size of the poppy by using larger needles i would like to gift this pattern to other knitters to knit poppies for the remembrance charities who support those who fought for us and for the families of those who gave their lives"
