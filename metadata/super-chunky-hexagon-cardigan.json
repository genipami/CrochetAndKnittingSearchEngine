  "notes": "if you've never crocheted a \"hexagon cardigan\" before, you are in for a treat.  this might just be my new favorite way to crochet cardigans! two hexagons, crocheted just like a 6 sided, solid, granny square form both the body and sleeves of this cardigan at the same time. done in super bulky yarn for instant gratification and methodical sleeve decreases to make this chunky project an every day, wearable piece. a free pattern available on my blog! now with a video tutorial as well!
