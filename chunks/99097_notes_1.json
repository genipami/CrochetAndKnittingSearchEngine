    "content": "one day i needed an ornament for a gift wrap and knitted this leaf for it inspired by julie weisenberg s knitted wreath 1 the leaf is knitted in the round on 3 needles and the stem is made in i-cord you might as well use it as a christmas tree ornament with a longer i-cord and a second leaf added to the other side it makes a lovely cord to wrap around a gift or add it to the top of a hat i imagine it even as a branch existing out of a long i-cord with leaves sprouting out on numerous sides 1 http //www ravelry com/patterns/library/knitted-wreath 2 http //www sudsandsoda com/div/justaleaf pdf"
