  "notes": "geometry class is in session! but don’t worry, this lesson is nothing but mind-bending fun. in the mezzo cardigan crochet along, you'll begin by crocheting two relaxing hexagons which will magically transform into the sleeves, a back and sweater fronts. this technique is so fun and interesting to watch come together.\r\n\r\nwhile making the mezzo cardigan, you’ll have a chance to practice working in the round, crocheting puff stitches and learning how to add a knit-esque ribbing to your sweater. very in-depth step-by-step video tutorials will guide you each step of the way. \r\n\r\nyou can’t beat the drape of this comfy, lightweight sweater and you’ll enjoy trying it on as you go.
