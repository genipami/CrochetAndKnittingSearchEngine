  "notes": "happy holidays from verypink knits!  this free pattern includes a free video tutorial, which can be seen here on my website:\r\nhttps://verypink.com/2018/12/05/double-thick-cuff-hat/\r\n\r\nthe faux fur pompoms are from this etsy shop, i used the 4\" size:\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/fffabuknits\r\n\r\nthe yarn i used knit picks capra in magnolia and blush. the yarn i used in the worsted-weight hat is knit picks wool of the andes tweed in papaya heather and oyster heather. for the hat with the single-row stripes, i used the technique of helix knitting. (helix knitting is a bit more complicated than a single-color cap, i would recommend using helix knitting in your cap to only more confident knitters.)  here is my video on helix knitting:\r\nhttps://verypink.com/2018/03/07/helix-knitting-jogless-one-round-stripes/",
