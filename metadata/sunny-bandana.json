  "notes": " sunny bandana is a quick and easy design. this pattern only uses one needle size and less than a ball of yarn that makes it perfect to travel with. great to use up some of the awkward yarn quantities in your stash!\r\n\r\n bandana is worked from the tip up increasing on every rs row. side finishes worked simultaneously. i-cord ties are knitted in one piece starting from one side, binding off the body with applied i-cord and then knitting the second i-cord tie without breaking the yarn.\r\n",
