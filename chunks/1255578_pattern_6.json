    "content": "this may lead to some holes in the armpit area of the sweater this is not a problem you can sew them up when you are done however you can alternatively pick up 4 extra stitches 2 before the underarm picked up stitches and 2 after and reduce these stitches in the first round by knitting them together with adjacent stitches as shown in the video k 10cm in stockinette now begin to add sleeve decreases by knitting a decrease round once every 23 15 16 12 8 6 4 rounds with stockinette rounds in between decrease round k1 k2tog k until three stitches before the bor marker ssk k1 continue until you have knitted a total of 2 3 3 4 6 8 11 decrease rounds continue in stockinette until the sleeve measures approximately 33 33 34 34 34 35 35 cm from the underarm cast on stitches or 7cm less than the desired length again note the sleeve may grow with blocking switch to 4 5mm needles and k one round then work in rib *k1 p1* for 7cm and bind off loosely note for some sizes you may find the 40cm needles become too long to knit the sleeve with as you decrease and have fewer stitches left on your needles in this case you can use the magic loop technique demonstrated in the video to continue knitting the sleeve on 80cm needles for some sizes this will not be necessary to finish weave in all ends put the sweater into cool water and leave it to soak for a few minutes gently squeeze out excess water without twisting or stretching it and then lay the sweater flat to dry at this point you can shape the sweater while wet to your desired measurements i d be really happy to see any finished sweaters shared on instagram under #stepbystepsweater thanks florence instagram @handmadebyflorence"
