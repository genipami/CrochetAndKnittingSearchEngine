    "content": "colwith force in the lake district is one of my favourite places a beck winds its way through a gorgeous woodland creating a series of beautiful and extremely loud waterfalls the colwith mittens were inspired by these falls - a trickling pattern bordering a forceful cable if you re ever near little langdale visit the mittens are knitted bottom up in the round beginning with a twisted rib before moving into a fairly easy and repeatable cable pattern the addition of a row of scrap yarn allows the mitten to be opened up and fingers added at the end if you prefer the convertible option **this pattern is free - but i do ask a favour** i would be enormously grateful if you would donate how much you think this pattern is worth my testers agreed somewhere around \u00a33-5 i would appreciate a donation to one of these three charities - the national trust who look after so much of the uk keeping it green and accessible the lake district mountain rescue team or your local team if you prefer or north-west air ambulance these three charities rely massively on donations and are all amazing causes doing great work within the lake district and the wider uk if you re outwith the uk feel free to donate to a similar charity where ever you are the outdoors should be accessible to everyone and these charities keep it that way **skill level ** advanced beginner - some knitting experience is preferable the cable pattern is easy to follow and repetitive making colwith mittens the perfect first cable pattern **sizing ** the colwith mittens are available in 4 sizes i suggest picking between sizes based on if you prefer a looser or tighter fit 1 9 by 3 - approx 100yds/92m - 148yds/136m 2 10 by 4 - approx 136yds/124m - 190yds/177m 3 11 by 4 5 - approx 160yds/146m - 210yds/192m 4 12 5 by 5 - approx 194yds/177m - 244yds/223m **yarn ** i used irunthisknit s hand-dyed dk yarn which i highly recommend my test knitters all used different yarns - see the suggested yarns for some of their picks the pattern should work equally well with any dk weight yarn one 100g skein should be enough **gauge ** 6sts and 7 row =1 x1 in stockinette stitch with larger needles **needles ** - 3 50mm - 3 75mm **notions ** - cable needle 3 75mm or smaller - tapestry needle - scissors - buttons if required for convertible version **advanced techniques** - cabling - twisted rib"
