  "notes": "the very first mystery sock i ever designed was for the solid socks group on ravelry. it was inspired by cimorene, the tough and no-nonsense princess in the enchanted forest series of books by patricia wrede.  her faithful companion through these books was a dragon named kazul. i dearly love dragon stories and have always wanted to design a pattern inspired by kazul, and now was the right time for it.\r\n\r\nthis mystery kal will take place during march 2024 in the  [solid socks group ][1] here on ravelry.\r\n\r\nparts will be released on: march 1, march 8, march 15, and march 22\r\n\r\n\r\n**yarn:** fingering weight sock yarn, 440 yds/100 gms\r\n\r\n**needles:** 2.75 mm (us size 2), or size to give gauge\r\n\r\n**gauge:** 8 sts = 1”, 11 rows = 1”\r\n\r\n**sizes:** 7. (8, 9, 10) inch circumference\r\n\r\n\r\nnote: this pattern uses an average amount of sock yarn; if you are an addicted sock knitter, you know what works for you! for everyone else, unless you are knitting socks with a very long foot, one skein (100 gms) of sock yarn will be sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/discuss/solidsocks/4301963/1-25#4"
