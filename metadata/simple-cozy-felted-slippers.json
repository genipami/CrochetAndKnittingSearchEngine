  "notes": "**beginner-friendly, stress-free felted slippers worked flat and in the round.**\r\n\r\nsuggested yarn: 100% wool suitable for felting (non-superwash). bulky or aran weight wool works best.\r\n\r\neven if your gauge is a bit off, your tension isn’t perfect, or your stitches look a little wonky — don’t stress! felting evens everything out and shapes the slippers beautifully.\r\n\r\ntrust the process, enjoy the knitting, and let the washing machine do the magic!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
