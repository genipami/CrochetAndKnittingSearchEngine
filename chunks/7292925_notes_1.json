    "content": "thank you very much to my ravelry friend majesty1 for suggesting such a marvellous name seems to describe it perfectly this border can be added to any square or rectangle with a multiple of 6 stitches + 4 along each side originally designed in monochrome to edge a blanket of elaborate squares this border works just as well and looks completely different in lots of colours make it as fancy as you like the picots in the last round are optional - leave them out if you prefer a smoother shell edging the pattern is available in a choice of us or uk terms a first for me the instructions are clearly written and carefully laid out to make them as easy as possible to follow and there are photos to illustrate every round despite using some interesting textured stitches it can be tackled by a confident beginner many many thanks as always to my eagle-eyed testers lara abbi and ellen for your invaluable help"
