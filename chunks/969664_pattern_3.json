    "content": "right number of stitches -hold the needles parallel and slip a third working needle into the first stitch on each of the two needles wrap yarn around working needle as if to knit and knit the two stitches together allow the first stitch from each of the parallel needles to fall from the needles -knit together the new first stitch on both parallel needles in the same way as above there will be two stitches on the working needle -using one of the two parallel needles pass the first stitch on the working needle over the second stitch and off the needle as you normally would when binding off -repeat from * until only one stitch remains on the working needle break yarn and pull the tail through the last stitch to fasten_off kitchener stitch cut off your ball of yarn with a tail approx 3x the width of what you are grafting hold your two needles parallel to each other with wrong sides together first set up like this 1 go into 1st st on front needle as if to purl pull yarn up and leave st on needle 2 go into 1st st on back needle as if to knit pull yarn up and leave st on needle then start grafting like this 1 go into 1st st on front needle as if to knit pull yarn up and drop st off needle 2 go into next st on front needle as if to purl pull yarn up and leave st on needle 3 go into 1st st on back needle as if to purl pull yarn up and drop st off needle 4 go into next st on back needle as if to knit pull yarn up and leave st on needle repeat steps 1 - 4 until all the stitches have been worked the big trick is how much gauge you use when you pull the yarn up through the stitches you want to have enough gauge so that the stitch being created isn t saggy but not so much that it s tight and distorts the line of stitches you are creating abbreviations approx = approximate ly beg = beginning k = knit p = purl st s = stitch es round s = round s repeat = repeat rs = right side ws = wrong side decrease = together pm= place marker sm= slip marker ssh oct 19 3"
