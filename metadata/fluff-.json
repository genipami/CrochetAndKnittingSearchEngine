  "notes": "boomerang shape (a name my husband coined to describe [linen weave boomerang](/patterns/library/linen-weave-boomerang) and which i've stuck with for this shape). \r\n\r\nbig needles for an ultra fluffy texture (and to make the yarn go further ?).\r\ndesigned specifically with lace-weight mohair in mind. \r\n\r\nmake a small kerchief size (about 125cm - 4' long) with just 25g (half a skein of the rowan yarn or a single skein of  the lang mohair) - great little luxury gift. \r\n\r\nor use up to double that amount for a huge fluffy cloud of a scarf. \r\n\r\nthe size you see in photo #4 was made with 35g (300m/330yds) and is about 170cm/68\" long. i stopped because that was big enough for me, but you can keep going for an even longer one. \r\n\r\nphoto #2 shows the kerchief size (it was taken at 23g). \r\n\r\n**you can actually make this with any yarn, but mohair was used for the original ones**",
