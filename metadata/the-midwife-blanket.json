  "notes": "one really fun thing about bbc's television series “call the midwife” is its wide array of gorgeous baby blankets. it’s impossible as a crocheter to not notice them. one of them really caught my eye, and after some trial-and-error, i think i’ve managed to replicate the pattern, and i want to share it with you! wouldn’t this make the perfect gift for a new mommy who is a fan of the show?\r\n\r\nthe blanket is begun with a chain in multiples of 16, plus 6 to account for the spacing that occurs at the beginning of every row. i created mine with a light weight, super soft acrylic yarn, and a size g hook, however i think my pattern scaled out larger than the one in the photo. if you really want to get it exact, you’ll probably need to use a fine weight yarn and a smaller hook. it was already enough of a stretch for me to use a g hook to create an entire baby blanket, so you won’t see me attempting this with anything smaller. ;)\r\n\r\nit’s a fun project, one that will keep your brain engaged, and when you’re done you’ll have your very own straight-from-1950s-london baby blanket! (well, at least straight-from-the-set-of-a-1950s-london-tv-show.) have fun!\r\n\r\nthe original pattern appears in this vintage [patons 9930 booklet][1], and two others, using fingering weight yarn.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/sources/patons-9930-heres-the-choice"
