    "content": "based on a traditional japanese design this knitted knot bag has one long handle and one short thread the long handle through the short and wear it on your wrist use it to carry a few essentials when out and about or as a small project bag it would make a handy gift bag too the bag is worked in the round apart from the handles and is knitted in one piece with minimal sewing the stitch used is a dense one so there is no need to line the finished bag although i have included instructions for a covered base to give a flat bottomed bag the pattern is for two sizes of bag - the small one is 15 cm tall and the big one 23 cm both use dk weight yarn about 50g for the small bag and 90g for the bigger one the stitch pattern works well with variegated yarns and i ve used yarns with various lengths of colour runs so that you can see the different effects all my ravelry patterns are free to download but if you enjoy them please consider making a donation to the british liver trust where the money will go to fund research and support the families of children with a liver disease you can do this easily by going to my fundraising page here 1 happy knitting 1 https //www justgiving com/page/frankie-brown"
