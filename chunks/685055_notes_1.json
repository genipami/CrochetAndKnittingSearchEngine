    "content": "this scarf is literally shaped like a large letter v i love traditional triangle scarves but sometimes they are bulky underneath the neck i also love straight scarves but sometimes they don t lay nicely underneath the neck area this v-shaped scarf combines the best of both worlds - the ease and drape of a straight scarf and the decorative neckline v effect of a triangle scarf as always i have a youtube tutorial video to help you make this scarf as the v part in the front can get a little tricky enjoy"
