    "content": "necessary if your cozy is fairly tight fitting it will go on easier if you put it over the spout first my cozy has three row of single_crochet stitches around the bottom the stitch count for each single_crochet round should be 52 but it s easy to be slightly off this number if it looks neat don t worry if your stitch count doesn t come out as 52 create a pompom thread the loose ends from the center of your pompom through the center of your teapot cozy pulling the pompom as close as possible to the cozy weave the ends around the center stitches of the cozy and securing it making a knot if necessary yarn choices and size alterations your cozy is symmetrical so it doesn t matter which of the two holes is for the handle or spout the easiest way to place your cozy on your teapot is to put the spout through a hole first and bring the front edge down a little way before bringing the back down over the handle you will find this method easiest especially if you re cozy is on the tight side when choosing yarn you ll find cotton is less flexible or has less give in it and therefore will be a little more difficult to pull over the teapot i have used acrylic yarn for several teapot cozies which works well and many other blends of fiber will probably also work well you could make easy alterations to the overall height or width by using a bigger or smaller hook size and/or different yarn also consider putting more or fewer row in the increase section which will need to be a multiple of 2 you can add or subtract row in the side panels for different heights copyright for this pattern and images within it belong to zoe deterding you have acquired the right to print and use this pattern for your own personal use you may not distribute this pattern or sell electronic or paper copies of this pattern without the express permission of zoe deterding you may not translate or distribute this pattern into another language reproduce it or post it on a website without permission by downloading this pattern you are agreeing to these terms the same restrictions apply to all photographs and images in this pattern if you have any questions about how you are permitted to use this pattern please contact me via email my facebook page or ravelry \u00a9 zoe deterding 2015 \u00a9 24caratcrochet 2015 you are permitted to sell completed items you make from this pattern"
