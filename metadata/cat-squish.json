  "notes": "the cat squish is a cuddly calico kitty, and a very squishy, free crochet pattern on moogly! featuring bernat blanket, this pattern will sink its claws right into you - in the most delightful way!\r\n  \r\ni love using bernat blanket for my large amigurumi squishes, and the cat squish is no exception! for this one i used a standard skein of the white color, and then grabbed an o'go for the other colors, which i needed just a bit of.\r\n  \r\nof course, you can use leftover bits of whatever colors you like to create your own custom cat! and any worsted or bulky weight yarn you have works great for the whisker and mouth details - but i think bernat maker home dec is purr-fect!\r\n  \r\nthis pattern is free on the blog, or you can purchase the ad-free pdf !
