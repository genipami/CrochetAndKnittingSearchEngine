  "notes": "this is a very warm hat, designed to be worn hiking and winter sports. i my experiences all heads are not the same size and several of my friends with 22 - 24 inch heads could not find a hat to fit them.\r\n\r\nthe elwha river is a 45-mile (72 km) river on the olympic peninsula in the u.s. state of washington. from its source at elwha snowfinger in the olympic range of olympic national park, it flows generally north to the strait of juan de fuca. most of the river is in olympic national park.  the river is the site of the largest dam removal project in history. my friend tim, who this hat was designed for, has a great love for the elwha river. \r\n\r\ni have also designed the hat for worsted weight and sport weight yarn so look for those patterns as well.
