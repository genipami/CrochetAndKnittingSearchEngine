  "notes": "the twisted branches headband features two cables separated by slipped stitches on a reverse stockinette background. the headband is knitted flat. the pattern is a 12-row repeat.\r\n\r\nthe first and last 2 stitches form an i-cord edging, that makes the edges look neat and prevents them from curling.\r\n\r\nthe cast-on and bind-off edges are seamed together forming a decorative twist in the middle. the seam is hidden by the twist and is not visible."
