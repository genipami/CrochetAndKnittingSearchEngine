  "notes": "*designed to use just one skein (or more, it's easy to adjust) of any gorgeous handpainted yarn to make a shawlette for someone who's close to you too!*\r\n\r\nwant to try yarns dyed especially for this project? check my handdyed colors [here][1]\r\n\r\n***\r\nthis simple but stylish shawl is knitted from one end with gradual increases to form a triangular shawl which is fun to knit and easy to wear. the zigzag border with eyelets gives it a nice touch and makes the knitting interesting.\r\n\r\n**size** \r\none: approx. 166cm/65.25” wide and 38 cm/15” long at center spine.\r\n\r\n**yarn**\r\n1 skein of any fingering weight yarn.\r\n\r\n**needles**\r\n4.0 mm/us #6 circular needle (80 cm/32\" long). \r\n\r\n**other**\r\n1 stitch marker, tapestry needle for weaving. \r\n\r\n**gauge** \r\n17 sts and 44 rows = 10 cm/4\" in garter st measured flat after wet blocking.\r\nthe gauge isn’t crucial on this project, but differences will affect the finished size as well as the required yardage.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.cecilygroveyarns.com/"
