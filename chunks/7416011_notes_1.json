    "content": "this pattern was created as a gentle and approachable introduction to lace knitting for a beginner lace class i teach as the kerchief gets larger the space between the lace row becomes longer so you can knit this as small or as large as you like by continuing as the pattern indicates you can also use any weight of yarn you like and create a bigger squishier worsted weight shawl or a delicate mohair accessory just be sure to use the correct needle size for your yarn gauge is not a factor in this kerchief but you do want a fabric that will drape nicely and feel good against your skin the first draft of this pattern is published on 3/14/25 but will be updated with better photos later on this pattern has not been tested so if you notice any errors please feel free to reach out and let me know happy knitting"
