    "content": "like red wine bottles generally do not taper until the have an indentation on the bottom when the disk is done very last bit whatever the shape of your bottle just make sure you then continue up the sides of the bottle still working in you end before the taper starts the round until the hat is the height that you like you can then leave the hat plain add a brim to catch drips or just go making the brim optional crazy decorating it the brim is especially nice for catching drips and really makes the piece look like a hat but you can fasten_off when making the bottom you have finished the sides if you prefer that look make a chain four or five stitches long and join to make a if you do want a brim it can be any shape you like a top ring for the first round ch1 and then do single_crochet hat with a brim perpendicular to the sides of the bottle looks stitches into the center of the ring until you return to the cute sitting on the table before the wine arrives you could beginning continue doing single_crochet in the round also do a flared brim fancy shells or even a ruffle whatever design you choose you will need to do multiple increases every round to create the brim so that it stands away from the materials bottle it is not really possible to give good instructions for one bottle of red wine unopened you will be trying the this you will just have to crochet and maybe frog until you get hat on the bottle as you work if you like to sip while you a shape you like if you are doing a top hat to get a crisper hook you will need a second bottle edge consider crocheting through the front loops only on the yarn use any yarn or combination of yarns that you like first row consider making stripes or using two or more thin yarns when you are done with the brim fasten_off weave in all together you might want to stick to darker colors near the ends and dress your wine bottle for its debut top where drips are most likely to occur but that is up to you the fiber content will not matter much except that some 100% other ideas cottons or linens may stretch a bit too much to stay tight i think a felted wine hat would be cool but i have not yet around the bottle after a couple of uses you could even use tried it if you want to try felting a wine hat use a yarn for leather or plastic cord although these will not absorb drips which you have a good idea how much it will shrink during just make sure if your hat needs a bath that you wash it felting make your hat accordingly a bit bigger to start and gently in cold"
