    "content": "the shawl is triangular and is knit from the top down with increases on every right-side row worked at the edges and on each side of the center stitch the design combines a variation on the shetland twins pattern and the basic shetland tree pattern the depth of the edging can be changed by repeating row 253 266 of chart 5 the only difference between the row is the ends to deal with the shaping increases so you can stop whenever you want or when you run out of yarn i would have made mine deeper but i ran out of yarn i used a hand spun yarn spun from a blend of merino 75% and bombyx silk 25% warning - the pattern has not been test knitted by anyone other than myself so there may be errors please let me know if you find any and i will post a corrected version thanks 09-19-2024 version 2 fixed problem in chart 4 at the end of row 191 193 and 195 i am not sure how i managed to mangle that section up so badly but i did"
