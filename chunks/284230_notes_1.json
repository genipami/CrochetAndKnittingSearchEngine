    "content": "pattern includes sizing for all kindle models and for the ipad and includes both a written pattern and a chart option it can be knit in any of your preferred circular knitting methods although the cast on requires a long circular needle or dpns i knit the rest on 9 circular needles as it is my preferred method but 9 circulars are not appropriate for the cast on **eta 12/9/11** after initial feedback from testknitters most knitters had to go up a needle size or two apparently i forgot to mention to bind off please do there is an error in the 3rd row after you ve finished the chart or written cable instructions- the row reads as k2 p2 k2 p2 k2 p2 k2 p1 k2 p2 k2 p2 k2 p2 k2 twice the row should read as ** k2 p2 k2 p2 k2 p2 k2 p2 k2 p2 k2 p2 k2 p2 k2 ** twice basically you are now doing simple k2 p2 rib which aligns with the cable pattern since you decreased a purl stitch in each of the following row the sides are 4 or more stockinette stitches depending on the version you are making please let me know if you find any additional errata in the problem and feel free to pm me with questions if something isn t clear"
