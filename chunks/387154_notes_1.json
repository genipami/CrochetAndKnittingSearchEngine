    "content": "i am thrilled that this pattern is now available in both **english and portuguese** thanks to a gracious ravelry friend this is a simple pattern that requires sewing up since the gloves are knit flat or sideways you will need two colours of yarn really any old worsted weight yarn will do and about 70 m of each colour the zigzag pattern creates the fun effect great as a quick knit gift or as a stashbuster for those partial skeins my awesome testers have told me that this pattern is for the adventurous beginner which means you ll be introduced to one or two exciting new stitches in this pattern remember youtube is our friend play around with colour and try them inside out as well fun enjoy **special note* the pdf file of this pattern was updated on april 3 2013 thanks to a group of thoughtful testers the update provides some additional clarity on technique and method thank you testers"
