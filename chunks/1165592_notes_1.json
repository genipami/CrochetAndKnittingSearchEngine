    "content": "crochet top hat made using red heart and caron simply soft held together but you can substitute for bulky yarn if you prefer i used black from both colors because the slight color/texture difference makes an almost tweed-like appearance in the final piece which adds to the top hat effect i used just about a whole skein of the caron simply soft with a little left over easy to customize size by making more/fewer row of increase or adding more row for length a free video tutorial is available on my youtube channel at the link"
