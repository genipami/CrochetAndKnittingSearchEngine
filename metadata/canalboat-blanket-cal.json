  "notes": "from attic24 blog:\r\n\r\n♥ the attic24 canalboat cal will will run for 8 weeks in total, beginning on friday 10th january - that'll be the day when the pattern will be published here on my blog and i'll give you all the information you need to get started. i'll then give weekly updates every friday throughout january and february 2025 so that we can make the most of weekend hooky time.\r\n\r\n♥ there will be a full picture tutorial here on my blog for the new canalboat stripe pattern. weeks 1-6 i'll share the colour order for a set of stripes (around 8 sets of 4-row repeats each week). week 7 will be a catch-up week (darn in those ends!), and the final week 8 will be all about the border.\r\n\r\n♥ the canalboat yarn pack contains 15 x 100g balls of stylecraft special dk or 30 x 50g balls of yarnsmiths merino dk and is enough to make one blanket/throw. the blanket will measure approx. 120cm x 175cm (slightly smaller for the merino version). you will need two packs if you wish to make a larger/double bed size blanket. i'll give starting chain/pattern guidance for those of you wishing to make larger (or smaller) blankets. \r\n\r\n♥ there is no printed pattern included in this pack, all pattern info will be here on my blog, with updates every friday throughout january and february 2025. \r\n\r\n♥ all cal instalments (pattern and colour info) will remain free on my blog into the future so that it's there for you to access at a time that suits you. you don't have to squeeze your blanket journey into 8 weeks if you don't want to - take your time and work at your own pace.\r\n\r\n♥ something i often get asked - can you use your own colours, or use one of my other yarn packs and still join in with the cal? the answer is yes, of course you can! i appreciate that many of you will probably already have yarn that you want to make use of, and i really look forward to seeing your creativity with stash busting."
