    "content": "want to get a nice firm stuffing feeling but a common mistake is stuffing too tightly where the knitted fabric is stretched and distorted in an extremely unattractive way and it will ruin the look of your project the stretching creates holes that are both ugly and often let the stuffing leak out when you knit toys they generally go through a lot of wear and tear squeezing hugging tossing chewing and loving because when you knit the fabric you create has holes and has the ability to lose shape i often use pantyhose as a form of lining it s fairly simple and especially helpful with something like pet toys cut off a leg of an old pair of pantyhose or new ones cheap drug store ones are great and when you go to begin stuffing the toy insert the pantyhose sock into the toy and stuff directly into it this creates a lining that helps keep the stuffing in shape and in place through wear and tear when you get to closing up the toy just tie a knot in the end of the pantyhose and close the knitting around it happy stuffing a dooley & spud knitting pattern 2012 have any questions or need help -> dooleyandspud@gmail com"
