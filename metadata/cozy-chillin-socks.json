  "notes": "this is written for magic loop.  if you’re accustomed to dpns, it should be easy enough to adjust.  i don’t use dpns, so you just won’t see a pattern from me using them.  at least not for now :) \r\n\r\ni love a comfy pair of socks, but i’ve always been picky about making them.  i prefer toe-up, one style toe, one heel, blah, blah, blah….  i decided i should just go ahead and put my favorite pieces together in one simple pattern.  this pattern is for the heavier worsted weight socks i make myself to wear around the house.  since i’m not wearing shoes with them, i don’t worry about yarn with nylon or reinforcing the toes and heels.  anyway, here’s my picky way of doing socks!  hope you like them!\r\n\r\nyarn in samples:\r\ncascade yarns 220 superwash\r\nmary maxim natural alpaca tweed\r\n\r\nwritten pattern only.\r\n\r\nstitches needed:\r\nknit\r\nk2tog\r\nm1l\r\nm1r\r\npurl\r\np2tog\r\nslip\r\nyo (just for bind off)\r\n\r\n\r\nfollow me on facebook at www.facebook.com/finickycreations and instagram @finickycreations to find out about sales and new patterns coming out!\r\n\r\nif you have any questions, feel free to contact me through ravelry.  if you find any mistakes, or anything that seems unclear, please let me know so i can get them corrected asap.  thank you!\r\n",
