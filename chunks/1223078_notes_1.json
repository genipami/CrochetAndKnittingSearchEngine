    "content": "this linen stitch square is what i ve used for years to make dishcloths for myself as well as family and friends it s a great stitch pattern that works up quick and doesn t require too much concentration the finished fabric is soft and flexible due to the chain stitches which helps to lessen the density of worsted weight cotton different sizes can easily be achieved by starting with more or less chains as long as it is an odd number this pattern is for an 8 square using a 5mm hook i have also made a 7 square using a 5 5mm hook starting with 31 chains make multiple squares of different colours and attach them for a crochet quilt or make one great big square for a warm and cozy blanket"
