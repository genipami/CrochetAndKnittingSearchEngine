    "content": "we designed the stella flowy mesh crochet cardigan because simply put we want more lightweight garments in our wardrobe last year we made lots of cozy sweaters and thick cardigans and while we love them all we realized we need more first-layer tops and easy throw-overs that work better with indoor heating in the colder months of course if you crochet this now in july you will still get to wear it during cool summer nights and straight into early fall right now in peak summer we are styling the stella flowy mesh crochet cardigan with denim shorts and dresses as we move into crisp fall we will definitely be throwing this over loose jeans long denim skirts and white tees it s the perfect transition piece the stella flowy mesh crochet cardigan is an easy crochet cardigan pattern featuring long loose oversized sleeves and a relaxed square mesh stitch made using simple and beginner-friendly crochet stitches it s the perfect layering piece this free crochet pattern is designed with positive ease to give it drape and movement the neckline is simple and clean and we show you how to include cute little pockets this is a made to measure crochet cardigan which means you can customize the length width and overall fit to suit your own body and like all our made to measure patterns you don t need to swatch our gauge exactly we used dk weight yarn weight 3 which helps keep the cardigan flowy and lightweight we recommend using a yarn with good drape to highlight the open mesh texture"
