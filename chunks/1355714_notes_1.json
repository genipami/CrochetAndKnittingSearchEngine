    "content": "a perfect project for using up some scrap yarn this coaster is densely knitted in linen stitch creating a firm flat fabric with a woven appearance the woven-look texture looks lovely in a variegated yarn - perfect project for using up beautiful hand-dyed scraps as each coaster only requires approximately 10 grams of yarn or pair multiple smaller quantities of yarn together for a colour-blocked or striped coaster the small needle paired with dk weight yarn is a little tougher to work than on a larger needle but the payoff is worth it the tight gauge creates a very dense non-stretch fabric that provides excellent heat and water protection for your surfaces"
