  "notes": "the herringstone cowl is a true “one skein wonder” because – you guessed it – we’re using just one (8 oz) skein of red heart hygge yarn. \r\n\r\nthis cowl pattern is worked in a spiral until you run out of yarn so you literally have nothing to count, no stitches to mark (unless you want to of course), and involves minimal thought at all. this is a great netflix and crochet project."
