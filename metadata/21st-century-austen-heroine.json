  "notes": "*note: this pattern is available via my blog, as well as a free pdf download*\r\n\r\nmay this bonnet be a testament to the fact that necessity breeds innovation. after i was struck with a powerful urge to knit a chapeau of this style, a search led me to the realization that no such pattern exists (for adults anyway…per usual, my desired mode of dress is reserved for humans under 2 years old). \r\n\r\nwell, i thought, time to brush off my patternmaking skills and put together the hat of my dreams. after a few attempts, i developed “21st century austen heroine” so named after the fact that it is both romantic and a little odd – just like my favorite characters.\r\n\r\nthe bonnet can be worn fastened for an elegant look, or untied for an effortlessly cool vibe. while i chose a neutral shade to match my winter wear, i think this would look equally incredible in a vibrant shade. \r\n\r\nhowever you decide to rock your bonnet, may your chilly days be filled with wit, warmth, and love! ♡",
