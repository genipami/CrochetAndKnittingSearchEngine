  "notes": "materials\r\n- 1 (2) skein(s) of purl soho’s [alpaca pure][1], 100% alpaca yarn. each skein is 109 yards/ 100 grams; approximately 109 (218) yards required. we used alpaca pure in the color heirloom white for the baby hat and artemisia for the adult hat.\r\n- us 5 (3.75 mm), 20-inch [circular needle][3]\r\n- us 6 (4.0 mm), 20-inch circular needle\r\n- a set of us 6 [double pointed needles][4]\r\n\r\ngauge\r\n22 stitches = 3 inches in rib pattern (unstretched), using the smaller needles\r\n30 stitches and 14 rows = 3½ inches by 2⅛ inches in cable stitch pattern, using the larger needles\r\n\r\nsizes\r\nbaby (adult)\r\nto fit head circumference 14–16 (20–23) inches\r\n\r\nnotes\r\nwhen knitting the body of the hat, i found it helpful to separate each repeat (30 stitches) of the cable pattern with a stitch marker. (just be sure to use a different color marker for the end of the round!) alternatively, you could knit the whole hat on double pointed needles and put each repeat on its own double pointed needle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.purlsoho.com/alpaca-pure\r\n  [2]: https://www.purlsoho.com/yarn/knitting-crochet.html?yarn_stitches_per_inch_filter=971\r\n  [3]: https://www.purlsoho.com/tools/knitting-needles.html?type_filter=881\r\n  [4]: https://www.purlsoho.com/tools/knitting-needles.html?type_filter=888"
