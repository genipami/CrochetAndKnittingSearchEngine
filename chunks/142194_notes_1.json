    "content": "an ear warmer that uses less than half a skein of malabrigo worsted more like a quarter of a skein -- perfect for left overs note the pattern as written is for a small to average woman s head with a bind off in pattern k2 p2 it has some stretch but it can also be sized up by adding 8 stitches to the pattern so cast on 88 instead of 80 88 stitches made it a little loose for me"
