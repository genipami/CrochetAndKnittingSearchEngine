  "notes": "this is a mitten pattern that has thrums added for extra warmth for those cold, cold winter days.  the wooly thrums are soft and cushy inside the mitten and make your hands, oh, so happy!  \r\n\r\ni wrote this pattern because i couldn't find one with the kind of top i liked or one that told the knitter exactly where to place the thrums and decreases in the top of the mitten and top of the thumb so that they looked symmetrical.  this pattern is intended to be easy enough for someone who has never knitted with thrums before.\r\n\r\nif you make up the thrums before starting the hand of the mitten, the knitting goes quite quickly and before you know it, you will be cozy and warm with your new mittens.\r\n\r\nthis pattern has not yet been test knit.  please let me know if there are any errors or if you have any problems. \r\n\r\nmany thanks to [krazyquilts][1] for formatting this pattern for me!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/people/krazyquilts",
