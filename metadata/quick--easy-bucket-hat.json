  "notes": "this bucket hat is quick to work up and perfect for beginners!\r\n\r\nthe sizing is very adjustable. by doing less rounds on top, you get a smaller size. doing more rounds will result in a larger size.\r\n\r\nyou’ll need 1 skein of your preferred yarn, a crochet hook, some scissors, and a yarn needle."
