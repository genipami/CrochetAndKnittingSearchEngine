    "content": "i made another version for a swap but then thought they might make an interesting pattern each bath mitt is made in one piece and has a stiff and scrubby side which uses highly-textured post stitches and a soft and lacy side which uses a combination of shells and double_crochet the stiff sides are intermediate to experienced in difficulty the smooth sides are easy to intermediate you can make the mitts out of any worsted weight cotton or cotton blend like the lion cotton used here or sugar n cream this pattern has not been tested by anyone except me - comments and testing welcome"
