    "content": "would say line up the rectangles right sides together so that the single crocheted seam would be hidden on the wrong side but i want this to have a more disjointed look as if it was hospital bracelets stacked on your wrists 3 if you add up the number of stitches the two large rectangles should be approximately 35 stitches 5 stitches x 7 rectangles by 28 stitches fold the two 35 stitch sides together wrong sides together starting from the top single_crochet down this seam for 5 stitches to join skip the next 8 stitches leaving them un joined and single_crochet down the next 22 stitches to join weave in ends sizing the size that i have charted out should make a women s size small to make larger sizes increase the chain amount at the beginning of the pattern in increments of 2 i wear a women s medium/large so i will probably add 6 stitches to make my squares 5 stitches by 34 stitches but i and you will have to experiment you could even make the gloves longer by increasing the height of the rectangles i e do 6 row of 28 single_crochet or whatever instead of 5 and so on since the embroidery is done after the squares are made the sizing should be easy as you won t have to center anything whilst crocheting and really it would look better if the embroidered lettering wasn t even or centered as these are supposed to look like stacked hospital bracelets the colors were chosen to make the whole thing look dirty and/or tainted if you ve seen the movie this will make sense if you haven t\u2026you should look into it this pattern is copyright 2008 by nichole m verville this pattern can be used as long as i am credited for the pattern the finished product from the pattern may be sold as long as i am credited for the pattern the pattern may not be sold without permission from me"
