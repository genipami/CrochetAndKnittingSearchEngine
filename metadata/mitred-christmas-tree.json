  "notes": "these simple decorations also double up as gift tags for that  special christmas gift. the pattern uses garter stripes and simple shaping, so they're suitable for any skill level.\r\n \r\nknitted with less than 10g of dk yarn, they're perfect for using up those extra scraps, and the quick, repetitive design means they can easily be finished in less than an hour.\r\n\r\nthis pattern will make a tree decoration approx 11cm tall.  to make a larger or smaller tree, simply increase or reduce the number of cast on stitches.\r\n\r\n**details** \r\n* yarn \t~ dk weight yarn ~ approx 7g / 15m per 11cm tree\r\n* needle\t~ 3.5mm\r\n* notions ~ stitch marker, darning needle\r\n\r\n**abbreviations** \r\n* k\t\t~  knit\r\n* pm\t~  place marker\r\n* rm\t~  remove marker\r\n* rs    ~  right side\r\n* s2kp\t~  slip 2 stitches together knitwise (this will give them a little twist), knit the next stitch then pass \t\t    the 2 slipped stiches over the knitted stitch and off the needle (2 stitch decrease)\r\n* ws  \t~  wrong side\r\n"
