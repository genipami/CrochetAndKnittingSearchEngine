    "content": "i love these to wear as scarves or to wear as shoulder wraps that stay in place i made mine from gradient kits from mont tricot but you could use any mini balls or scraps or just do it in one solid colour because i have colour changes i kept the edge plain but i am experimenting with edging\u2026and you should too this pattern uses the so-called linen stitch which is really just chain single_crochet pairs repeated"
