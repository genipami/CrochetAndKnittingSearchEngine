    "content": "quokka socks there are some great sock patterns available but i really wanted to record a formula for socks that can be used for almost any yarn/hook combination i also wanted the socks to be worked from the toe up so that you can easily try them on as you go and to have short-row heels because they re neat and simple additionally i wanted the socks worked in extended single_crochet because it s thin and smooth and stretchy for crochet hence the quokka socks pattern i named this pattern after the cute little marsupials that only live here in western australia - famously on a small island off the coast where roger federer took a selfie with some of them last year materials any yarn between a 4ply sock weight and a 12ply aran weight using a hook that gives you a firm fabric the amount of yarn you need will depend up the size of sock you make the length of leg you work and the weight of yarn you use for example i only used 56g for my 4ply socks but that s light weight yarn and i made very short leg sections because i wanted ankle socks gauge a gauge swatch is essential for this project and it won t take long make a chain 5 long and work at least 5 row of extended single_crochet esc so that you can measure your 4 worth of stitches well in from the edges no need to work in the round this will be near enough count the number of stitches you have in a 4 section and divide that number by 4 that s your gauge in stitches per inch spi which you ll use in the stitch count calculation below g = notes standard american terminology used scinc = single_crochet increase - work 2 single_crochet into the same stitch esc = extended single_crochet please google if you re not sure decrease = single_crochet 2 together to decrease again please google if you re not sure sizing and fit i made the socks shown here in a sock weight yarn with a 2 5mm hook at a gauge of 7 stitches per inch spi you can however use the pattern with almost any yarn/hook combination with a little bit of maths my calculations/workings are shown in square brackets throughout the pattern as an example measure foot and calculate stitch count and starting chain 1 measure foot length 2 calculate sock length l by subtracting a negative ease of 0 5 from foot length 3 measure foot circumference at ball 4 calculate sock circumference by subtracting negative ease of 0 5 to 1 from foot circumference crochet is not stretchy so allow less ease than hand knitted and commercial socks 5 calculate stitch count s for the foot and leg sections by multiplying your gauge in stitches per inch g by your sock circumference and round that number to the nearest multiple of 4 6 divide your stitch"
