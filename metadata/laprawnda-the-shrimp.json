  "notes": "knit in cascade sunseeker, laprawnda is a sparkly little shrimp who makes a nice guard for your stash, a gift for a friend, or a welcome addition to a knitted seafood salad.  \r\n\r\n* laprawnda can be knit at any gauge-- use super bulky to make a jumbo shrimp, or sock yarn for a tiny baby prawn. (using size 3 needles and dk yarn, laprawnda is about 2\" from tail to nose.)\r\n\r\n* adjust your needle size according to whichever yarn you choose- i suggest going down two or three needles sizes from what your yarn recommends.  this way, you will get a nice, firm fabric that will hold stuffing well.  \r\n\r\n\r\nonce you've made laprawnda, don't forget to make her husband shawn and perhaps some of their spawn!
