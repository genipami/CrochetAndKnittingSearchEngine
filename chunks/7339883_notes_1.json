    "content": "when we go hiking i like to have something to keep my hands warm while i use my hiking sticks but i want my fingers free to take photos with my phone camera i wanted something that didn t have a lot of pattern in it and was fast and easy to knit up so i had to cast these on they are pretty simple and easy to knit i think a beginner would be able to make these one size fits all but you can add stitches in multiples of 2 to make it bigger or decrease stitches in multiples of 2 to make it smaller 6/6/2025 updated pattern added length between ribbing and thumb made pattern directions clearer"
