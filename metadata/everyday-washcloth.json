  "notes": "knitted washcloths are one of my comfort knits.  it’s the project i go to when i need to keep my hands busy and my mind calm.  plus, they are quick, useful in your home, and make great gifts.\r\n\r\nthis is the traditional knitted washcloth that a neighbor taught me when i was about twelve years old.  the pattern has been around forever, and i don’t know where it came from, and i don’t claim it as my own, i just wanted to write it down and share it.  \r\n\r\nmy go-to cotton yarn for washcloths is berroco pima 100.\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy this pattern!",
