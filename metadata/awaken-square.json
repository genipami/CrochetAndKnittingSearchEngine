  "notes": "i have designed this awaken square specifically for the fabulous bamcal to celebrate the final month of winter; february. the word february originates from the latin word ‘februa’ meaning ‘to cleanse’ and is often seen as a month of purification. a month of self care and nurturing, as well as expressing love to others at valentines. the new year, new projects and new resolutions have begun as we come to the end of winter, with anticipation and hope for the start of spring. soon we will see those first buds bloom and the landscape come bursting back into life and colour as the earth awakens.\r\n \r\nthe centre is a delicate blossom flower, in anticipation for the blooming branches soon to canopy above our heads, this is surrounded by a circle of little buds, the first signs of new life after winter; using puff stitches with front post stitches to accentuate them. the ring of lace is to symbolise a delicate hug. the circular centrepiece is then surrounded with a burst of greenery and joyful sprays of mini buds. for the border i wanted to replicate rows of little crocus flowers. \r\n\r\nthis square is best suited to intermediate/advanced crocheters (or adventurous beginners) due to the complexity of some of the stitches, but includes photos of each round and explanations of the stitches at the beginning of the pattern.\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy making this square as much as i enjoyed designing it. if you like the pattern, please have a look at the other designs in my ravelry store, or follow me on instagram @the_burrow_uk to see what i am working on next. thank you. \r\n\r\n#bamcal2024 #awakensquare"
