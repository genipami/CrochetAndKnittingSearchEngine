    "content": "the ripple pattern in this design is created by working dc3tog twice to form valleys and working 3 double_crochet in each of 2 stitches to form peaks in each row the crocheter must take care that valleys are centered over valleys and peaks are centered over peaks of previous row the blanket is made using lion brand mandala yarn which is self-striping and eliminates the need to change colors the color changes are subtle so the effect is very pleasing the pattern calls for two skeins of lion brand mandala yarn and a size h crochet hook"
