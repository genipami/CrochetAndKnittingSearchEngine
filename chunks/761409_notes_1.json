    "content": "a friend of mine needed a pair of basic fingerless mitts to keep the chill of the air conditioner off her hands in the office she wanted something understated but not plain so i chose a super soft alpaca and row of a basic but interesting stitch pattern i made the cuff and the top of the mitt ribbed to allow a comfortable fit on many hand sizes mitts are worked in the round from the right side no turning as written the seam really the column of chains at the start of each round runs up the right side of each thumb toward the palm of the left hand and toward the back of the right hand i find this seam to be very subtle when worked in a solid color yarn with a nice halo also i asked my friend if the seams bothered her that way she said what seams if you desire instructions for moving the thumb gusset to the other side of the seam please let me know"
