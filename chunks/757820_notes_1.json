    "content": "if you are like me and are perpetually cold when it s even just a little chilly out then this is the perfect accessory to couple with a v-neck coat or for tucking in under a cardigan this pattern uses just a touch over 50g of worsted weight yarn and works up in no time great for a one-skein project or a last minute gift easy intuitive pattern that is wide open for adding your own personal touch to design is easily unisex--although some men may find the scallop edging too feminine and opt to leave it off **items made from my patterns are intended for personal use sale or world domination--as long as i get a parking space wherever i want once the world is yours **"
