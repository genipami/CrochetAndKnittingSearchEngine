  "notes": "**pattern description**\r\nthe twist to the classic beanie uses simple stitches with intervals of increases and decreases to give is a nice wavy effect.\r\n\r\nto add to that, the pattern is mostly worked in back loop only which adds a lovely ridged texture to it. this crochet beanie pattern is simple but unique and works up fast. furthermore, it's easy to customize in terms of size, fit and colour.\r\n\r\n**skill level:** beginner\r\n\r\n**size options:**\r\nthe free pattern is offered in one size that fits most teens and adults. with the pdf, you get 7 additional sizes that range from newborn all the way to large adult.\r\n\r\n**materials needed:**\r\n•\t5 mm crochet hook\r\n•\t#4 worsted weight yarn\r\n•\tpompom (optional)\r\n•\tdarning needle\r\n•\tscissors\r\n\r\n**yarn details:**\r\nthis pattern uses approximately 230 yards of #4 worsted weight yarn. this pattern is a good match for solid color to bring out the textured stitches to their best advantage. however, if you want to use variegated yarn, i recommend complementing it with a solid colour for better stitch definition."
