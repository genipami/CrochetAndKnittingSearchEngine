  "notes": "for this square i used dk yarn and a 4mm hook, but you can use any yarn or hook suitable for your project. if you want to make this to fit in with a bamcal[^1] project, please note that i have made this with the same yarn and hook as i do for the bamcal “12 inch” squares, which are designed for aran/worsted yarns. this comes out for me at roughly the same (smaller) size as my bamcal “12 inch\" squares (very slightly over 9 inches). \r\n\r\nthis pattern is available in uk and us terms. please let me know if you have any problems with the pattern (downloading, opening, reading, making the square ...) and if you spot any errors.\r\n\r\nthere are two versions of each - the full version includes round by round (finished) photos and stitch charts. throughout both patterns there are stitch photos to accompany the instructions for each round.\r\n\r\n[^1]: bamcal is the \"crochet block a month cal\" and there is a new one for each year. there are two 12 inch squares and one 6 inch square (if worked in aran/worsted) each month. you will easily find them by searching the full name in groups search."
