    "content": "if you can find beads with a big enough hole you can thread them down each hanging loop before these loops are joined together to decorate your plant hanger or you can stitch beads on as required a special tip if the hole in your beads isn t quite large enough you can place a length of sewing cotton through the top of a single loop thread both ends through a suitable needle then thread this needle through the bead s and push them down over the chain a plain or beaded tassel sewn on to the bottom looks good too keeping the four hanging chains as straight as possible loop them over your finger and tie them all together through the top with more yarn making a hanging loop at the same time or attach them to a ring as shown below grasp top of ring through loops and and pull chains downwards to tighten the weight of your pot will minimise any remaining twists at the top ready to hang heartfelt thanks to reimy angelstarknit for testing this pattern and for offering the special tip above \u00a9 christine bateman 2021 catswhiskerscrochet@gmail com"
