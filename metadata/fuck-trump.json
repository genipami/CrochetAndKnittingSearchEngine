  "notes": "with so many lives being unnecessarily lost, with so many black and brown people being murdered, with so many babies in cages, sometimes, you’ve just got to angry-knit. so, if this tickles your angry bone, i hope you will join me in declaring “fuck trump” with every angry stitch. normally, i say, “happy knitting!” but today, i say, “fuck you, trump!”\r\n\r\ni am not asking for money for this pattern. but i am asking that you vote if you are eligible, that you turn others out to vote, that you march, that you give money and/or time to your favorite justice organization. together, we can overcome hate.\r\n",
