  "notes": "designed with comfort and joy in mind, the everfrost hat is decorated in beautiful columns of simple cables with a traditional 2x2 folded brim. thoughtful decreases subtly evoke the silhouette of a snowflake on the crown. this hat takes just one skein of your favorite worsted-weight yarn, and to add a touch of magic, you can add a strand of a silk/mohair blend. \r\n\r\n**sizes**\r\none size\r\n\r\n**finished measurements**\r\n**brim circumference (unstretched)**\r\n18” / 45.5 cm\r\n**height (with brim unfolded)**\r\n11.25” / 28.5 cm \r\n\r\n**yarn**\t\r\n**sample 1 (white version)**\r\nuniversal yarn deluxe worsted (100% wool; 100g/220 yds) – 1 skein of 12257 pulp\r\nlana gatto silk mohair (75% superkid mohair, 25% silk; 25g/232 yds) – 1 ball of 6028 cream\r\n\r\nsample 2 (green version)\r\nhudson & west co. forge (70% merino, 30% corriedale; 100g/235 yds) – 1  skein of evergreen\r\n\r\n*or*\r\napprox. 201 yds / 184 meters of any worsted-weight wool yarn\r\n\r\n**needles**\r\nus size 7 (4.5 mm) 16” circular and set of dpns (or a long circular for magic loop) for main hat pattern, *or size needed to obtain gauge*\r\nus size 6 (4 mm) 16” circular (or a long circular for magic loop) for ribbing, *or one size smaller than the needle used to obtain gauge*\r\n\r\n**notions**\t\r\nsix stitch markers (one unique marker to denote the bor), cable needle, tapestry needle\r\n\r\n**gauge**\t\r\n24 sts x 27 rnds = 4” / 10 cm in main hat pattern with larger needles\r\n*always use the needle size that results in the correct gauge. gently wash and block your swatch before measuring.* \r\n\r\n**pattern notes**\r\nthis hat is knit seamlessly from the bottom up. it begins with the cast-on method of your choice. i used a long-tail tubular cast-on with stitches rearranged for 2x2 ribbing – there are many tutorials available for this method. other excellent options could include the german-twisted or cable cast-on methods, though a long-tail cast-on would work just fine as well. the crown decreases are worked into the cables – please read the special abbreviations section carefully.     \r\n\r\nthis hat is intended to be worn with 1-4” / 2.5-10 cm of negative ease. \r\n"
