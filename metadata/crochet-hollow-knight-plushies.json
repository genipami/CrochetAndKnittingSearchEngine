  "notes": "important!!\r\na few of the wonderful people who used my pattern noted that the eyes and the knights’ cape came out too big. i’d recommend using a smaller hook size for the eyes, and decrease the amount of rows on the knights’ cape if you run into this problem. i’ll see if i’ll find the time to look over the patterns and fix this!:~) happy crocheting! \r\n\r\nthis is a pattern to crochet hollow knight plushies (the knight and hornet). feel free to use any hook size and any kind of yarn that you would like to use! i personally used acrylic/cotton yarn and a 3 mm hook. my plushies ended up about 12 cm (the knight) and 15 cm (hornet) tall!"
