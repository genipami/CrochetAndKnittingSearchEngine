    "content": "this is a simple beginner-friendly scarf that works up quickly and looks great the subtle texture adds a bit of interest without distracting from the beautiful gradual colour changes of the scarfie yarn this scarf uses my preferred version of the v_stitch which creates a denser and in my opinion much nicer-looking fabric i came up with it while trying to make a scarf for a male friend i wanted it to have some texture without being too lacy and feminine only one skein of scarfie is needed as advertised on the label gauge is not important you are free to sell anything you make using this pattern but please do not sell the pattern itself or otherwise claim it as your own"
