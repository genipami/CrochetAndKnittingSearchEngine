    "content": "this tunisian crochet ten stitch blanket is a conversion of frankie brown s ten stitch blanket knitting pattern 1 a while ago i approached frankie and asked her if it would be okay for me to write a crochet version of her blanket i was thrilled to bits when she agreed no sooner had i finished the pattern for the crochet ten stitch blanket 2 though than i started working on the tunisian crochet ten stitch blanket both with frankie s blessing and encouragement and here for your hooking pleasure is the resulting pattern i would like to thank frankie once again for letting me convert her wonderful pattern into another medium if you can call it that this pattern is free but if you would like to show your appreciation for frankie and her designs you are more than welcome to make a donation to the children s liver disease foundation through frankie s just giving page 3 the ten stitch blanket is worked in a spiral or rounds of row around a central square of 10 stitches by 10 row the beauty of the project is that the short row 10 stitches per row less on the corner row propel you forward like you wouldn t believe and it is the perfect pattern for using up any and every scrap of yarn in your house if you decide that your ten stitch blanket is large enough simply stop at the end of one of the middle sections and work a slip_stitch row as indicated at the end of the pattern and have i mentioned that you don t even need a tunisian crochet hook for this because there are so few stitches in each row a regular old crochet hook will do and might even be easier to wield you don t really need to know how to do tunisian crochet either each step is explained thoroughly with loads and loads of photos to help you on your merry way if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me have fun xxx dedri 1 http //www ravelry com/patterns/library/ten-stitch-blanket 2 http //www ravelry com/patterns/library/ten-stitch-blanket-crochet-pattern 3 http //www justgiving com/frankiesknittedstuff"
