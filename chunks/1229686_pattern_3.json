    "content": "join does still have a slightly raised stitch which influenced the placement and order of the joins i ve included a youtube link for the flat slip_stitch that i found helpful the hardest part about joining the squares this way is that on one side of each square where the last row of the square was tied off one stitch is sometimes too small to crochet into either try to get a stitch in there or go in slightly lower or directly next to that stitch it doesn t really matter as long as the same amount of final stitches is the same on each square another note when flat slip stitching the three stitches between treble_crochet groups the first slip_stitch goes through the 2 back loops of 2 squares the 2nd slip_stitch back loops of the very corner chain of all four squares and the 3rd slip_stitch goes through the last open chain on the next two squares there should only be 3 total slip stitches between groups of 3 treble crochets when joining over a spot that has already been slip stitched together chain one over that spot instead here is the order to flat slip stitch them together in step one is to go all the way from top to bottom in these 2 row -> *be careful not to twist the squares especially row 1 when doing row 2 and to make sure the correct side of the squares are facing you* step two is to do the two row all the way around the middle of the bag tie the ends of each row together step three is to do both of the long sides of the bottom of the bag step four is to do the sides of the bag all the way from front to back making sure to match the same direction as the original two middle row weave in whatever ends need to be weaved in any ends on the top can just be crocheted directly over when doing the border on the top and do not need to be weaved in step three the top border the top is 7 row of single_crochet and 4 chain three holes for the straps row 1 facing the thin side of the bag join with a slip_stitch in the top right most chain space of the top square chain one single_crochet into the same hole as join and single_crochet in every stitch all the way around the top of the bag crocheting one into one into the corner hole one into every join and one more into the following corner hole to make a total of a group of three in those areas there should be 144 single crochets per row to finish the row join with a slip_stitch to the first single_crochet and chain one skipping the original chain 1 you may crochet directly over all of the top loose ends from the bag instead of weaving them in row 2 1"
