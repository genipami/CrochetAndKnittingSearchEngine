    "content": "the fuck-it bucket stash buster extraordinaire the fuck-it bucket is a recipe rather than a pattern flex it to use as much of your scrap stash as you like mix weights fibres colours textures there are no rules here the recipe base of the bucket start with a magic loop single_crochet* single_crochet six stitches into the magic loop then pull the loose end of the loop to snug everything up i find it helpful to put a removable stitch marker in the first stitch of the round from here you need to work increases two single_crochet into each stitch 12 stitches total two single_crochet into first stitch one single_crochet into next stitch six times 18 stitches total two single_crochet into first stitch one single_crochet into next two stitches six times 24 stitches total two single_crochet into first stitch one single_crochet into next three stitches six times 30 stitches total you make two single_crochet into the first stitch on every increase round with two three four five six etc regular stitches between them keep working until the base of your fuck-it bucket is big enough to suit you i like mine on the big side and usually work between 15 and 18 rounds for the base walls and handles when you re happy with the size of the base keep working single_crochet into every stitch with no increases this will build the walls of the bucket keep going until you think the walls are nearly deep enough for me it s usually the same number of rounds as i worked for the base lay your bucket so the top edge that s the last stitches you worked are lined up and put markers in the centre stitch on each side work out how many stitches wide you want your handles i usually make mine the width of my palm plus one stitch count back from your centre markers and put another marker on each side of the bucket to mark the start of the handle single_crochet up to and including the stitch with the first handle marker chain twice as many stitches as there are between the markers so if there are six stitches between the markers chain twelve then single_crochet into the stitch with the second handle marker repeat for second handle on the next round single_crochet over each of the chain stitches work a few more rounds until the handle feels sturdy and your fuck-it bucket is as deep as you want it to be then finish by slip-stitching around the whole edge * single_crochet is us terminology that s equivalent to double_crochet/double_crochet if you re using uk terms useful info matching yarn and hook size the fuck-it bucket is crocheted holding lots of strands of yarn together to make sure the bucket is sturdy i put the bundle of yarns through a needle gauge and use a hook to match so if my yarn bundle goes through the 8mm hole on my needle gauge i use an 8mm"
