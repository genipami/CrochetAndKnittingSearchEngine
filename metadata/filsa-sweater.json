  "notes": "the word ‘filsa’ means button in tunisian, and seemed like the perfect fit for this adorable little sweater! it features a cropped body and three-quarter sleeves, and is knit seamlessly top-down. you’ll start by working flat to create the button opening and then join to work in the round after the raglan increases. the simple lacework only uses two techniques, and can easily be left out of the pattern to suit a different style. the sleeves are knit using the magic loop method, with an i-cord bind-off that mimics the rolled hem at the neck edge.\r\n\r\nthere is a full youtube tutorial that i have created to show the sweater knit step-by-step:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/djnwswwdhhq\r\n\r\nfinished measurements: \r\n\r\nchest circumference: 17 (18, 19, 20) inches / 43 (45.5, 48, 51) cm\r\nyoke depth: 4 (4.5, 5, 5.5) inches / 10 (11.5, 12.5, 14) cm\r\nsleeve length: 4.5 (5, 5.5, 6) inches / 11.5 (13, 14, 15) cm\r\ntotal length: 8.25 (9.25, 10.25, 11.25) inches / 22 (25, 27.5, 30) cm\r\n\r\nyarn:\r\n\r\n2 (2, 3, 3) skeins of drops merino extra fine by garnstudio \r\n\r\nor 170 (195, 235, 265) yards / 146 (178, 214, 242) meters of dk weight yarn.\r\n\r\nneedles:\r\n\r\n-16 inch / 40 cm us6 (4mm) circular needle\r\n-32 inch / 80 cm us 6 (4mm) circular needle\r\n\r\nnotions:\r\n\r\ntapestry needle, 5 stitch markers, scrap yarn, 1 button (approx. 1-1.5 cm)\r\n\r\ngauge:\r\n\r\n21 stitches and 28 rounds"
