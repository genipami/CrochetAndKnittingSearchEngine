  "notes": "mythology or reality? the reality is that tarragon is a dragon with a tender heart and an obscure predilection for french cuisine. he will only blow fire for bbq-ing some sausages - to eat with lots of onions and garlic sauce! \r\none day to knit, one second to love! \r\n(but beware of his breath!!)\r\n\r\ntarragon is stiched on the round using double-pointed needles from bottom to head and is about 24 cm high.\r\n\r\none skein main colour (50 gr) is largely sufficient to knit tarragon. plus you will need about a quarter of a skein to knit wings and spines.\r\n\r\nenjoy!\r\n\r\n**thank you to [dragonbasket][1] for the german version! **\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/people/dragonbasket"
