  "notes": "this design was born out of a need to get in the spirit of spooky season. after trawling through what felt like an infinite number of autumnal knitting patterns, i decided that i would have a go at making my own chart, ready for the -ber months.\r\n\r\nthis page isn't a complete knitting pattern, it will give you the tools you need to make some pretty socks like the ones above."
