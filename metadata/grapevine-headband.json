  "notes": "the grapevine headband features a 13-stitch lace panel in the middle flanked by two mirrored 1×1 cables on a reverse stockinette background.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is an 8-row repeat. \r\n\r\nthe first and last 2 stitches form an i-cord edging, that makes the edges look neat and prevents them from curling.\r\n\r\nthe the cast-on and bind-off edges are seamed together forming a decorative twist in the middle. the seam is hidden by the twist and is not visible."
