    "content": "this season i m experimenting with different shapes of slouch and this pattern has a rounder more droopy look to it than my patterns from previous seasons it s worked from the top-down but uses the faux-cinched method i tend to favor but amped up a bit we re cramming so many stitches into those first few rounds that you might be thinking yeah right rebecca as you re getting started but trust me just get through those first rounds and it will get easier and the finished look will be so worth it for this pattern i used lion brand yarn s vanna s style a #3 weight not to be confused with vanna s choice which is a #4 aran it has beautiful stitch definition and drape which is perfect for this hat my model is rocking this hat with her natural waves but it would also look gorgeous over cascading curls or even a loose braid"
