    "content": "this is a pattern for a small hanging ornament the instructions are for making a bear but it can also be used to make a rabbit by using the ears from my free teeny tiny knitted toys pattern here https //www ravelry com/patterns/library/teeny-tiny-knitted-toys the pattern uses only small scraps of yarn and can be quickly knitted up the assembly is a little fiddly and you can save time by making the dress part a few row longer and not bothering with making the legs hope you have fun with it j x updated to a new pdf file december 15th 2021"
