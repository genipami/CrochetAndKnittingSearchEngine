  "notes": "check out my other free patterns as well for more seasonally inspired socks.\r\n\r\nsocks are knit from the cuff down, a lacy and simple cable texture. the pattern is easy to memorize and charted only. the pattern uses the magic loop method but it is easily adaptable to your favorite method. traditional heel flap and wedge toe are used as well. the pattern is written for one size, it is adjustable by simply changing your needle size. adding or decreasing purl stitches between lace stitches is an option if you need to go up or down in actual stitch count. i used a solid color in one of my favorite sock yarns, the texture really stands out.\r\n\r\n“and the spring arose on the garden fair,\r\nlike the spirit of love felt everywhere;\r\nand each flower and herb on earth's dark breast\r\nrose from the dreams of its wintry rest.”\r\n\r\n\r\n― percy bysshe shelley",
