    "content": "this is a very warm but not windproof hooded cloak it is especially excellent to use around the house in the winter the difficulty of this pattern is mostly endurance rather than complicated stitches gauge is not important for this just make sure the fabric drapes nicely i used a looser gauge for mine because i was using scraps i can only estimate the yardage used as about 15 skeins 2 775 yds i made it for myself and am about 6 tall so you may find that you don t need as much yarn if you are shorter or want the cloak to be shorter i highly recommend using a highly textured yarn like homespun because it gives the cloak a more solid look and softer feel i included several hand drawings in the pattern to help explain what i did let me know if things are still confusing and i will try to clear them up also i apologize in advance for my lack of drawing skills lastly i did not include any specific color instructions i used several different colors of homespun from top to bottom of the cloak i used herb garden meadow prairie harvest wildfire the hood is just prairie and harvest and the border is all wildfire since it is so difficult to find 15 skeins of a single dye lot i recommend choosing a several colors that go together happy crocheting"
