  "notes": "thousands of knitters have enjoyed making my now famous \r\n'all-in-one baby top'. \r\ni see them everywhere!\r\n\r\neach one is a little different ~ depending on the yarn used, additional fancy stitches or edgings, and the buttons and trimmings ~ and each and every one of them looks so cute!\r\n\r\nit has been my most popular pattern ever.\r\n\r\ni have been asked many times for a version with sleeves. i know several people have adapted the pattern - but somehow i just didn't think they looked so cute with sleeves. i have tried over and over to make a pattern i was happy with - and at last my perseverance paid off! \r\n\r\ni love the way this looks.     yipee.........  \r\n \r\n\r\ncan't wait to see the first one made from my new instructions. \r\n\r\ndk (8ply) yarn\r\n4mm needles \r\n\r\nmatching hat also available \r\n\r\n\r\n**to get this free pattern please click on the https link just below\r\n↓**"
