    "content": "when it s cold outside you want a supersoft warm cap to keep your head toasty this easy hat works up in a flash and the super bulky yarn and size 13 needles creates a dense fabric that will keep the chill away all winter long it s a great quick gift for someone you love - or for yourself the stripes and pompoms are optional but add a fun touch *warning the sample version had approximately 6 of mc leftover when complete - if you wish to make this hat longer or without the stripes please make sure you purchase an extra skein of mc so you have enough for your project *"
