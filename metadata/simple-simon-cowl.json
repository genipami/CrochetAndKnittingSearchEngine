  "notes": "this is a cowl that i made with a special skein of malabrigo rios that i bought as a treat for myself.\r\n\r\ni really liked the way this knitted up and  i would like to share it with my fellow knitters.\r\n\r\nso get out your special skein of worsted weight yarn, or just go stash busting.\r\n\r\ni did not use the full skein, only about 180 yards.\r\n\r\nthe cowl is an easy 2 row repeat with knit rows in between.\r\n\r\ni did do an i-cord bind off, but a regular bind off, would work as well.\r\n\r\nthere are lots of youtube videos on doing i cord . my favorites are \r\n knit purl hunter and 10rows a day.\r\n\r\n*disclaimer: this pattern has not been tested.*\r\n                    i am not a professional pattern writer or designer.  i do my best to make the pattern user friendly and correct.  if you find errors, i apologize in advance and please let me know.  \r\n\r\nthank you and happy knitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     ",
