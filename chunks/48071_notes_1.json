    "content": "to keep in mind with this pattern you want to use a relatively stiff yarn that will hold it s shape super soft drapey yarn will make this hat floppy now if you want a floppy brimmed hat go for it those are fun too the katia marathon sportive i used was a wool blend yarn that had a stiff body to the fiber in a dk/sport weight that i doubled to work this up quick and thick bulky yarn could be used in place of that single stranded but it will need to be stiff/firm fiber to hold shape the design itself is a very basic brimmed hat that is open for all sorts of customization for creative crocheters add ribbon for the hat band like i did or add anything that suits your fancy to it"
