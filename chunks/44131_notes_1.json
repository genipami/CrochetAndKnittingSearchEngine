    "content": "this is a very popular hat as a newborn gift but it will serve for longer as the deep rolled bottom means the hat will stay put when stretched over a larger head after over 7000 ravelry projects completed since publishing this hat in january 2008 i m revising the pattern august 2015 as follows 1 the pattern is now available in the ravelry pattern store so it s easier to get and you don t need to rely on the old pdf link from a hackable wordpress blog 2 there were some complaints from a few people that they couldn t get the leaves to stand up and twist so i ve made that section clearer and tested it with someone who had never made the hat before 3 there s now a chart for the leaf section including the color strand section and the decreases to form the twisted leaves there are still written instructions as well and i think they re clearer too 4 general instructions for adapting for a toddler or child size are included 5 i welcome translations the previous pattern was translated into 5 languages and a magic loop mod if you d like to share these please message me and i ll incorporate these into the pattern on another revise"
