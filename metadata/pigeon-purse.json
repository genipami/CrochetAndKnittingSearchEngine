  "notes": "this crochet purse makes for a unique, crossbody bag in the shape of the classic urban avian.\r\n\r\nthe pigeon purse is made by first crocheting a series of flat body and wing pieces. the pieces are then sewn together and the beak and feet are added, with some stuffing to fill the beak and wings. after the crochet portion is finished, a cloth lining and zipper are attached to the inside and opening of the purse, and a strap is attached at either end.\r\n\r\n**materials**\r\n\r\n*hook:*\r\n\r\n* 4.5mm crochet hook\r\n\r\n*yarn:*\r\n\r\nthis pattern was designed and crocheted with gründl  lisa in the colors steingrau (dark gray), petrol (teal), and weiß (white), and schachenmayr bravo in the colors hellgrau meliert (light gray), schwarz (black), and kürbis (orange), and requires the following approximate quantities.\r\n\r\n* light gray:  80 g / 213 m / 233 yds \r\n* dark gray:  21 g / 56 m / 62 yds \r\n* black:  12 g / 32 m / 35 yds  \r\n* teal:  8 g / 22 m / 24 yds  \r\n* orange:  7 g / 19 m / 21 yds\r\n* white: approximately 40 cm / 20 inches of scrap yarn for embroidery on the beak\r\n\r\nthe purse can also be made with any other dk weight yarn that can achieve the correct gauge.\r\n\r\nthis pattern has not been tested--i designed it as a gift for my brother and have published it as a free download. if you notice any typos or other errors, please feel free to let me know.\r\n",
