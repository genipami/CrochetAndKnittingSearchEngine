  "notes": "our latest creation is a crochet pattern for a toy mouse for cats and kittens!\r\n\r\nfinished size:\r\n\r\napproximately 7 cm long (not including tail) using dk/light worsted weight yarn and 2.75 mm hook.\r\n\r\nyou can use any yarn and hook combination that gives you good tension. normally this would be a hook at least two sizes smaller than that recommended on the yarn label. changing the size of the hook/yarn will change the size of the mouse.\r\n\r\nmaterials: \r\n• yarn \r\n• crochet hook\r\n• stuffing\r\n"
