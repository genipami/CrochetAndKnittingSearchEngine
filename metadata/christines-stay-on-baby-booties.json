  "notes": "from fuzzy galore: \"this pattern was published in threads no 22 (april 89) in a letter to the editor from christine bourquin.  she was at the time 95 and living in redwood city ca, still knitting, and expressed the desire to have her pattern live on.  as christine would be 108 today, we can only hope that she's still around, but perhaps she's not able to see well enough to still make them. ...christine's legacy is this pattern for booties that stay on because of the clever side ribbing, and as we all know keeping booties on babies is not a straightforward task...\"\r\n\r\n\"christine used red heart acrylic baby yarn or a 3-ply wintuck but recommended trying one of the new superwash wools as well....the many colorful sock yarns for adult which are usually superwash wool and reinforced with a bit of nylon.\"\r\n\r\na helpful tutorial can be found on the [yarn, books & roses][1] blog.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://yarnbooksroses.com/2014/05/04/swedish-family-bootie-pattern/"
