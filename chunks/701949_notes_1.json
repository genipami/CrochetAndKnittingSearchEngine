    "content": "this pattern is based on the shawl worn by saffron in the episode our mrs reynolds in the tv show **firefly** using still-shots of the tv show i tried my best to replicate the classic chevron lace that composes this shawl to be absolutely true to the show the yarn from the still-shots looks like it would be a cranberry color brushed acrylic or mohair blend this gorgeous tweed is the closest i could find to the correct color and i m quite happy with it but if anyone does find that perfect yarn- please give me a shout this triangle shawl has a top-down construction built from a small foundation chain a linen stitch neck-line adds structure and support details include the keyhole at the top-center of the spine and a flirty edging of fringe materials willow yarns daily tweeds dk 2 skeins = 568 0 yards 519 4 meters 200 grams in ancient jasper or 568 yds similar dk weight yarn 5 5mm/i hook or size needed to get gauge although gauge is not really essential scissors blunt tip needle for weaving in ends stitch marker size size is completely adjustable by changing the weight of the yarn size of the hook or working fewer/more row of the pattern sample shown in the photo is blocked to be 74 across the shoulders and 31 deep you can use worsted weight yarn with a 6 5mm/k hook and stop anywhere after row 15 for a super quick project gauge pattern is a two-row repeat in the sample shown blocked distance between one dc3tog to the next is 5 5 blocked length of 6 row 3 repeats is 5 however gauge is not essential to this project i tried to closely approximate the size of the shawl in the tv show but you can customize this to your own personal taste and preference pattern uses us terminology written and charted with detailed photos a special thank you to my awesome testers you were amazing to work with"
