  "notes": "i love knitting textural stitches of all kinds and especially love incorporating them into the socks that i design and knit. i run the full range from very challenging lacy or cable designs to simple knit/purl combinations that are just enough to add some interest while still being easy  and fun to knit. these are some of the latter kind of socks!  \r\n\r\nthis design grew out of a simple 2/2 ribbing starting point because i didn’t want to clash with the gorgeous long run color gradient of this yarn. as such, the socks retain a lovely stretchiness that is very forgiving when it comes to those of us blessed with thick ankles, high insteps, wide feet and the like. after some test swatching, i came up with this stitch pattern that reminded me strongly of…*something*. hmmm, i just couldn’t put my finger on it. it made me nuts for a few days and finally it came to me: newly tilled or plowed furrows in a corn field in the spring!\r\n\r\n> you see, i don’t have a farming\r\n> background at all, **but**: my first\r\n> faculty position after graduate school\r\n> was at a small university in the\r\n> midwest set amongst corn and soy\r\n> fields as far as the eye could see. it\r\n> was a real change for me, having only\r\n> every lived in urban settings.  i\r\n> remember being at first confused and\r\n> then highly amused by an op-ed in the\r\n> local newspaper that very seriously\r\n> warned farmers to not get carried away\r\n> by the suddenly warm and beautiful\r\n> spring weather by jumping on a big ol’\r\n> tractor and tilling some fields up and\r\n> down just for the fun of it. not\r\n> planting anything, mind you—that has\r\n> to be meticulously timed for each\r\n> crop.  nope—this was just riding\r\n> around and tilling or turning over the\r\n> soil in the fields. \r\n> \r\n> now, to be fair, we did have quite\r\n> long, gray and slushy winters that\r\n> always seemed to drag on about 6 weeks\r\n> too long, so one can hardly blame\r\n> farmers for wanting to get out and do\r\n> something when it finally did warm up.\r\n> the writer called this phenomenon\r\n> “**recreational tilling**” and everyone in\r\n> the community knew exactly what that\r\n> meant (except for stupid me). it turns out that too much\r\n> tilling is a bad thing—it increases\r\n> labor and fuel costs and contributes\r\n> mightily to soil erosion/loss. all of\r\n> these are serious issues for farmers,\r\n> of course, and while i had heard about\r\n> “*agricultural practices*” (a nice,\r\n> vague term) and “*erosion*” (also a huge\r\n> umbrella term) i had never actually\r\n> lived in a farming community and heard\r\n> about a real practice that factored\r\n> heavily into those concepts. and never\r\n> mind one so enchantingly termed,\r\n> “***recreational tilling***”. so i have\r\n> named these socks for their regular\r\n> furrows and commemorated that unwise\r\n> but irresistible practice of riding\r\n> around on a large piece of farm\r\n> equipment in your t-shirt, plowing the\r\n> fertile soil, enjoying the sunny day\r\n> and the cool but not cold breezes on\r\n> your pale bare arms for the first time\r\n> in several months. even if its not\r\n> such a good idea—sometimes you just\r\n> *can’t* help it. :-d\r\n\r\n*anywho*, these socks are worked from the top down with a heel flap, standard gussets and a wide toe. the socks shown are worked in size l and easily fit a women’s us size 11 (european size 41).  this l size would also accommodate the smaller men’s sizes while size xl would be perfect for larger men’s sizes. sizing is generous for all of the sizes: do not size up. the stitch pattern is given as a simple chart and as fully written out instructions.\r\n\r\n> **yarn recommendations:** long run color\r\n> change yarns (as shown) are great.\r\n> solids or tonals would also be ok.\r\n> variegated yarns are ok, but if there\r\n> is too much variegation, the pattern\r\n> will not show up as well.\r\n\r\n",
