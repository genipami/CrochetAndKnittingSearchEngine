  "notes": "purchasable pdf pattern: https://www.etsy.com/listing/602723872/modern-double-crochet-v-stitch-blanket\r\n\r\n*i think [the double crochet v stitch] is actually a great beginner stitch once you’ve mastered double crochet because it’s pretty easy to always see where you need to insert your hook.  i love how even the lines turn out and i love that the v stitches make the stripes look like small chevrons*\r\n\r\n*one thing you should know about this stitch is that it does work up quite loose because of the gaps between the v’s so you may want to do a quick practice swatch and experiment with hook sizes.*\r\n\r\nmaterials\r\n* 2 skeins of caron simply soft in white\r\n* 1 skein of caron simply soft in light country blue\r\n* 1 skein of caron simply soft in gray heather\r\n* size h hook\r\n* tapestry needle\r\n* scissors"
