    "content": "i ve been admiring all the knitted boomerang shawls on ravelry for ages and wanting to make a crochet one here s the result just like its knitted equivalent this shawl is worked sideways from one skinny end to form a distorted triangle gradually getting wider as you increase every row on one edge but only decrease every second row on the other edge the stitch unit for this shawl is the v- stitch double_crochet chain double_crochet and the asymmetric increasing/decreasing forms a vortex hence the v_stitch vortex you can use any yarn and hook combination you like that gives you a drapey lacy fabric so far i ve made it in light fingering weight yarn and in dk weight and both are great i have used standard us terminology please let me know if you spot an error happy hooking ps i ve just republished the pattern to include written instructions as well as the chart"
