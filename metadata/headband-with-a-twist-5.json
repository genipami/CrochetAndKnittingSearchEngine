  "notes": "the headband is knit back and forth in the english rib, which is very warm and comfortable to wear. it has a twist in the middle - not only this looks classy, but it’s also a clever way to hide the seam.\r\n\r\nthe size is easily adjustable.\r\n\r\nfor this project, i chose an alpaca and wool mix, that is warm and just a little fluffy. the yarn is very soft and great to work with. i used less than one skein."
