    "content": "shoulder wrap this is not so much of a pattern as it is for a guide because you can vary it according to the size you need it s really just a simple stitch that you probably wouldn t need a pattern for but then again half the purpose of a pattern is to give you the idea of something to make \u263a this can serve as a good guideline for beginners too i suppose i saw something in a book and it was the only item in there i liked but i didn t like it enough to buy the whole book i wish now i remembered what it was anyway i came home and made one up myself the original design was stitched in a yarn that had a metallic strand i didn t have one so i again made that up myself ~original pattern called for 2 balls of yarn each 82-yards though i used 98-yard balls myself my yarn was mongolia by dynasty yarns ~hook size i or so if your yarn is a bit bulkier than worsted depends on your yarn - adjust accordingly maybe an h with worsted and add more stitches or a j for extra bulky and add fewer stitches per row ~to add the metallic gleam i bought a spool of metallic sewing machine thread coats you can find this at wal-mart mine was silver hold both strands together while crocheting this project chain 89 important check to be sure this is big enough to go all the way around your shoulders to the desired length before continuing your yarn hook and desired project size will vary turn and single_crochet in the 2nd single_crochet from the hook to the end of the row repeat until the wrap is as wide as you d like it to be and you re done to hold the wrap together and to give it a nice touch just pin it together at the top with a brooch or a pin now be sure to link your project on ravelry so i can see it"
