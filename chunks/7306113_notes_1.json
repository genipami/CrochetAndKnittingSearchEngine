    "content": "this is a randomly generated pickle pattern in google sheets 1 why randomly generated because my daughter wanted a emotional support pickle and the more i crocheted the more i realized that it was cooler with random stitches but i m a mathematician and a computer programmer so i really wanted to make it for real randomized this pattern allows you to virtually infinitely re-make the pattern so all your pickles will come out different it comes in three sizes small medium and large but if you want to make any of those longer or shorter you can re-randomize the pattern and add row - just make sure you finish off with the right decreases i may add the little pickle pucker at the end later but for now this is merely the pattern randomizer terms in non-alphabetical order - sorry * magic_ring - magic_ring with the number of single crochets noted * increase - increase by crocheting two single crochets into the next stitch * st - stitch * single_crochet - single_crochet * lg bobble - large bobble - i do the first half of three double crochets to get 4 loops on the needle then pull through all of them but you can do any kind of bobble - just as long as it s a bit bigger than the small one * sm bobble - small bobble - i do the first half of two double crochets to get 3 loops and then pull through all of them again as long as it s a bit smaller than the large one you re set * slip_stitch - slip_stitch * half_double_crochet - half_double_crochet * double_crochet - double_crochet * inv decrease - invisible decrease or just a regular decrease you can use the google sheet here but please only change the number of interesting things and the random number at the top 1 i m working on a way to share the the excel sheet if you want it private message me and i ll just email it for now 1 https //docs google com/spreadsheets/d/1nkipm5glwaxyja2kinwgivk-qy2y1nfjs72ov4iux2e/edit usp=sharing"
