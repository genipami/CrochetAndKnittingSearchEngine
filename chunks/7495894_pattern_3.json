    "content": "tunisian full stitch is very stretchy especially vertically so with strategic blocking using the pattern provided a wide range of lengths/widths could be achieved this blanket pattern could be very easily adjusted to a longer/shorter length by continuing the color pattern longer prior to the final repeat adjusting to a lesser/greater width can also be achieved by subtracting/adding to the starting chain if adjusting the width just be sure to track the starting chain sts and remain consistent when working this pattern correctly the number of starting chains should dictate the total working stitches throughout remember to count and stay consistent when adjusting either the length or width please keep in mind that the amount of yarn needed will change and be sure to account for it it is better to have one skein too many than one too little"
