    "content": "this pattern for a scarf worked in the iris stitch a beautiful lace-looking crochet stitch the pattern can work with any yarn and any hook size as long as your starting chain is a multiple of 4 you keep going with the stitch until it is to your desired length gauge is not important for this pattern - it can be any length or width you like i don t like particularly skinny scarves but you can make it thicker or thinner to your own taste i made this with 1 skein of sirdar shawlie in peony - if you ve used a thicker yarn you might need more than one skein to reach your desired length you will need a tapestry needle to weave in the 2 ends you will have at the end"
