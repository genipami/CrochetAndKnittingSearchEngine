  "notes": "this year, i am slightly obsessed with socks and while knitting my christmas sweater, i was thinking about a matching pair of socks. after some intense research on ravelry, pinterest and google, i couldn't find what i was looking for: some bigger but not too big holly leaves, some bobbles, but also a kind of plain but elegant looking rest of the sock. so, i took out my coloring pencils and started drawing a couple of charts.  \r\n\r\ni've added some tips for the colorwork as well as charts for 60, 64, 68 and 72 stitches.  \r\n \r\n\r\n**material**\r\n------------\r\n\r\nyou will need: \r\n\r\n* 4-ply fingering sock yarn of your\r\n  choice in white (i've used ca. 50g) or main color of choice, in green (ca. 5g)  and in red (8 meters)\r\n* your favorite sock needles in 2,25 mm and 2,5 mm or in the sizes you usually use for colorwork socks. i've used dpn sets of 5 needles in 2,25 mm and 2,5 mm \r\n* tapestry needle \r\n* optional: a tiny crochet hook, for example 1,5 mm . the crochet hook can help to work the bobbles, but you can also work them with your knitting needles "
