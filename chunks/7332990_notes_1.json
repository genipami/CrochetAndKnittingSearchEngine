    "content": "the hannah baby blanket combines garter stitch with a textured panel this is one of my favourite ways of constructing a blanket as the strips of garter stitch that separate the textured panel give a really nice rhythmic feel to the knitting and the design always seems to fly off my needles that bit quicker this blanket design incorporates a textured panel that harks back to my in fours baby blanket and uses stripes of garter stitch as separation - a technique i ve used in several other blankets harvey taylor and toby are good examples of this although it s a 20 row repeat its far from complex to master which makes it perfect for an advanced beginner to tackle gauge is not important as long as it remains consistent"
