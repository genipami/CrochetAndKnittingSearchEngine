    "content": "this blanket is very easy for anyone with the basic knitting skills of knit and purl the finished piece looks more difficult than it is to actually make the piece is comprised of square and rectangular shapes of stockinette reverse stockinette and seed stitch put together in a pattern that resembles a quilt the blanket pattern can be worked in any weight of yarn to create different size pieces but the instructions are based on 5 100 gram skeins of worsted weight yarn and a finished size of approximately 30 by 33 the simplicity of the pattern works if you have a busier yarn like the one shown in the sample the pattern can be modified by adding stitches and row to the borders to make them wider additional blocks or row of blocks can be added to the center panel block sizes can also be modified i think a larger number of smaller blocks could be an attractive option as well as the larger ones in the pattern"
