    "content": "this belt is worked from the top down everything on this belt is easy to modify you can make the tie wider and as long as you want leave about 3 inches of space without ruffles for tying if you re making this for yourself try it on before adding ruffle if you re making it for someone else leave 3-6 inches once tied as some yarn stretches you would rather have less ruffles than have the ruffles affecting the tie for ruffles the length is up to you for the sequin purple example i ran out of yarn so i could only do 2 row of tc and one row of double_crochet ideally i d do at least 3 row of tc the amount of double_crochet for the tiers depends on the number of row for your ruffles the last row of the above ruffles should cover half of the first row of ruffles in the next tier if you are adding a third tier repeat flo blo like the first tier"
