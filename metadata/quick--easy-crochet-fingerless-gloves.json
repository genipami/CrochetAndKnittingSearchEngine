  "notes": "they are a very simple design, made up of single crochet ribbing and the “even moss stitch“. this combination of stitches help add a lot of texture to these fingerless gloves and i am totally here for it! \r\n\r\nmaterials\r\n\r\nworsted weight (4) yarn – approximately 72 grams\r\n\r\n4.00mm crochet hook\r\n\r\ndarning needle\r\n\r\nmeasurements\r\n\r\ngauge:  4″x4″ square = 18 even moss stitches wide x 22 even moss stitch rows tall\r\n\r\nunsown glove: 7″ wide x 6 1/4″ tall*\r\n*you glove width may differ depending how wide you need for your glove to comfortably wrap around the palm of your hand. 7″ is the perfect width i need to wrap the glove around my palm.\r\n\r\nstitches + abbreviations\r\n\r\nch = chain\r\n\r\nst(s) = stitch(es)\r\n\r\nsc = single crochet\r\n\r\nsc blo = single crochet in the back loop only\r\n\r\nhdc = half double crochet\r\n\r\nsl st = slip stitch\r\n\r\neven moss stitch = alternate between working a sl st in one stitch and then a hdc in the next over an even amount of stitches. always start with a sl st and always end on a hdc each time you come upon the “even moss stitch” portion of the pattern.\r\n\r\npattern notes\r\n\r\n*this pattern follows us crochet terms.\r\n\r\n*turning ch 1 does not count as a stitch.\r\n\r\n*always work a normal sc into the first and last stitch of every row."
