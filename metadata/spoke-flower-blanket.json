  "notes": "a pretty blanket pattern that is also fun, quick and easy to make.  perfect for a last minute present. also an ideal way to use up odd balls of yarn. once the three round repeat has been mastered, the blanket can be made anywhere, any time, with ease.\r\n\r\nthe blanket can be made to any size, according to your preference. the pictured blanket is approximately 125 cm in diameter and 425 grams of 8ply yarn was used. this size is suitable for a baby blanket, or as a child or toddler sized throw rug. these blankets look especially lovely draped over the end of a child's bed.\r\n\r\ndouble the yarn strand and up the hook size to make a fabulous floor rug.\r\n\r\nany yarn can be used, however one that yields a good stitch definition is recommended. i have used panda carnival 8ply acrylic for the pictured blanket.\r\n\r\nfor pattern feedback or support, please message me on ravelry or the crochet fix facebook page. video instructions available at \r\nhttps://m.youtube.com/channel/uchf_xzxo5jju4kdzbfhntba.\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy making your blanket as much as i have enjoyed making mine.
