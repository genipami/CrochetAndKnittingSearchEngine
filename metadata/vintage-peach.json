  "notes": "vintage peach is a light and airy one skein crochet triangle shawl. the pattern is simplicity at its best! once you have the first few rows established, it is an easy make. when you have completed your shawl, it is the essential blocking that turns it into this beautiful delicate creation! add a touch of cream for the edging, and you have a vintage inspired crochet accessory to be proud of.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is very versatile and you can use any yarn you wish. a dk weight yarn (light worsted) and a suitable crochet hook, would also be perfect for a fast project and would make a cozy scarf/shawl for winter. you just stop crocheting when your shawl is large enough, or you run out of yarn. add a contrast border or make your shawl in a single colour.\r\n\r\n*you can find the free version on my blog*\r\n\r\ngauge is not important\r\n\r\n**materials**\r\nla bien aimee merino singles /400yds [366m]: merino superwash/100gr) in colourway peche pom pom\r\na small amount of fingering weight yarn for the border in cream, if you wish\r\n4mm crochet hook, or whatever hook size gives a loose tension\r\nyou can use 400m of any fingering weight yarn or yarn weight of your choice and matching hook.\r\n\r\n**measurements**\r\nshawl pictured measures 68 in [173cm] length x 22 in [59cm] depth after blocking\r\n\r\n**includes dutch translation**"
