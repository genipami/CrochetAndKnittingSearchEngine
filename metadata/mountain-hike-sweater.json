  "notes": "the mountain hike sweater is a simple, oversized raglan-sweater that you can effortlessly throw on for hikes in the mountains or just on chilly days during your everyday adventures. the positive ease allows you to wear it as a cozy sweater on its own or layered over other clothes in place of a jacket. the sweater features a mock neck, a slightly deeper yoke and long sleeves for extra warmth and comfort.\r\n\r\nthe sweater is worked seamlessly from the top down. it begins with a mock neck, followed by a section of german short rows to add extra fabric to the neck area. then the yoke is shaped by increasing on both sides of the raglan stitches. once the desired yoke depth is achieved, the work is divided into the body and sleeves. additional stitches are cast on under the arms to shape the underarm area. after completing the body, the sleeve stitches along with the underarm stitches are picked up and the sleeves are knit in the round with evenly spaced decreases.\r\n\r\n\r\n**sizes:** xxs (xs) s (m) l (xl) xxl (3xl) 4xl (5xl)\r\n**body chest circumference:** 74-78 (79-83) 84-88 (89-94) 95-100 (101-107) 108-114 (115-121) 122-128 (129-135) cm\r\n\r\n**garment chest circumference:** 88.75 (93.75) 98.75 (103.75) 110.00 (116.25) 123.75 (131.25) 137.50 (145.00) cm\r\nthe sweater is designed with 10-15 cm of positive ease around the chest.\r\n\r\n\r\n**gauge:** 16 sts / 24 rnds = 10 cm x 10 cm in stockinette stitch\r\n\r\n\r\n**yarn:** hjelholt triple by hjelholts uldspinderi (165 m / 100 g): 500 (500) 600 (600) 600 (700) 700 (800) 800 (900) g or any other aran weight yarn. \r\n\r\n**needles:** 5.0 mm (80 cm) for stockinette and 4.5 mm (80 cm) for ribbing or any other needle sizes to achieve gauge.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe sample shown in the pictures was knit with hjelholt triple by hjelholts uldspinderi in the colour \"nougat\" and has 13 cm of positive ease.\r\n\r\nif you need a size that is not included in the pattern, feel free to contact me. i will try to adjust the pattern for you.\r\n\r\nplease note that this pattern is available for free because it has not been test knitted by anyone other than myself. if you notice any inconsistencies, i would be happy if you shared them in the comments or sent me a message.\r\n",
