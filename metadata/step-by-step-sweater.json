  "notes": "the step by step sweater is a simple raglan sweater with no complicated techniques, perfect as your first garment knitting project. it has a relaxed fit and two options for the neckline.\r\nthis sweater also has an associated video demonstrating all the tricky steps in the knitting process.\r\n\r\noptional short row shaping is included.\r\n\r\nsizes: a (b, c, d) (e, f, g)\r\nif the pattern has not been graded into a size that fits you and you would like to knit this sweater, please contact me and i can grade some additional sizes as required.\r\nedit: two additional sizes will be coming this summer, to match the size range of my other patterns. thanks for your patience!\r\n\r\nmeasurements: approximately 90 (100, 110, 120) (130, 140, 150) cm finished garment bust measurement after washing and blocking.\r\n\r\nneedles: 4.5mm circular needles (40cm and 80cm lengths), 5.5mm circular needles (40cm and 80 or 100cm lengths)\r\nit is possible to use the magic loop technique to avoid the need for 40cm needles.\r\n\r\nyarn: nepal by drops (75m/50g)\r\nfor the striped version:\r\n7 (8, 9, 11) (12, 13, 15) skeins of the main colour\r\n3 (3, 4, 4) (5, 5, 6) skeins of the contrast colour\r\nfor a solid coloured version:\r\n9 (10, 12, 13) (15, 16, 18) skeins\r\n\r\nalternatively you could use the same length of one of the following yarns:\r\nalaska by drops (70m/50g)\r\nfishermen’s wool by lion brand (425m/225g)\r\neco+ by cascade (437m/250g)\r\nkos by sandnes garn (150m/50g)\r\nthe grey striped sample is knitted in nepal by drops. the brown textured sample is knitted in one strand of tennen by noro held with a strand of silk mohair.\r\n\r\n**please note:** there is one error in this pattern. if you are including the german short rows, once you finish the short rows, you need to knit back to the beginning of round marker before continuing (as shown in the video). if you are not doing the german short rows, this is not a problem.",
