  "notes": "**calla lily / peace lily** is an original crochet pattern by june gilbank.\r\n\r\na beautiful realistic tulip flower with a clever one-piece construction – you'll love how it comes together! add some colour to your life with a bouquet of everlasting tulips.\r\n\r\nhere are some ideas for use:\r\n\r\n* create a beautiful bouquet or vase of tulips\r\n* add a shorter stem to make a lovely tulip buttonhole \r\n\r\n**yarn:** small quantity of worsted weight yarn in a floral colour (e.g. white, pink, red, purple, yellow, orange, cream) plus yellow for the flower centre and green for the stem\r\n\r\n**hook:** us e / 3.5mm\r\n\r\n**additional info:** you'll also need a bamboo skewer, thin dowel, pipe cleaner, or floral wire to make the stems. \r\n\r\n**size:** i used worsted weight yarn and a size e hook, which produced a large 5\"x2\" (13x5cm) tall flower. (your gauge and yarn choice will affect the finished size slightly.) try using a finer yarn or crochet thread with a correspondingly smaller hook to give a more compact flower.\r\n\r\nnote: this pattern is donationware - the pattern is available for free, but if you like it please consider sending me a donation to show your appreciation. the pdf version, available for any size donation, is formatted for easy viewing and printing, and includes bonuses (additional assembly photos, bonus tips for a more resilient flower, and a special technique for fastening off the yarn neatly at the base of the stem). the complete pattern is available to view in full (for no charge) from the linked page.\r\n\r\n***\r\n> ***please join us*** *in the [planetjune crochet designs\r\n> group](http://www.ravelry.com/groups/planetjune-crochet-designs)\r\n> - you can get pattern support, join crochet-alongs, show off your fos,\r\n> suggest new designs, and chat. all\r\n> welcome!*"
