  "notes": "my sister-in-law (who incidentally lives in michigan, the nation's high-five) asked me for a no-frills mitten pattern using worsted weight yarn. i wrote this one for her. it is quite simple, worked in single crochet only. i have included a pattern for an optional star appliqué, but feel free to experiment with other embellishments, such as crocheted flowers or beading.  or not.  sometimes less is more.\r\n\r\n ",
