    "content": "this pattern calls for 96 stitches 96 can be divided into 8 12 times so before i even start casting on i get out 12 stitch markers and lay them out i always use a bright green one to designate the beginning of my round as i m casting on every time i reach 8 stitches i double check my 8-count and place a stitch marker when all my markers are used up i have the amount of stitches i need although i ll usually go back and count the markers to make sure i really have 12 - errors have been known to happen note on colors i ve found that it does work best to do at last 3 rounds of a color before changing again the slip knit round plus 2 more knit rounds this gives you enough color to actually see and adds stability to the knitting i need about 90 inches of yarn to complete a round so to do 3 rounds i d need about 270 of yarn sometimes if i m using up a teeny bit i need to measure beforehand to make sure i have enough there are several mini tutorials at the end pattern directions lay out 12 stitch markers with whatever color strikes you and using the long tail cast on method cast on 96 stitches placing markers every 8 stitches your distinctive beginning of round marker will be the last one placed i usually need to pull out about 75-80 of tail yarn to cast on this number of stitches using the long tail method a note on stitch markers for this pattern you don t really need them but i like them to keep me on track and i d definitely recommend them for the decrease rounds pattern is written assuming you have stitch markers on for the decrease rounds ribbing round * k2 p2 * with contrast color a work ribbing round until about 1 long if you want to change colors during the ribbing do a round of all knit no purls on the first round of the new color on the next round go back to the ribbing this may seem odd but there s a reason for doing it when joining a new color and using purl stitches you get an ugly in my opinion little bump that shows both the old and the new colors by doing all knit with the new color you won t have that you can add that single round of all knit in the middle of your ribbing and it will have virtually no affect on the stretchiness and will be almost invisible on the second round of the new color slip the first stitch purlwise to help hide color jog hat #18 scrap happy color change technique contrast round 1 * sl-1 k1 * with new color contrast round 2 knit with new color contrast round 3 knit with new color repeat round 3 for as many"
