  "notes": "hey knitters!\r\n\r\nthis pattern is available as a free digital download as a thank you for all of the support you have all shown my various ventures with crazy sock lady over the years. \r\n\r\nsending you all a great big hug and all of my love. ❤️ \r\n\r\nhappy knitting,\r\nkay\r\n\r\n*notes* \r\nthis pattern is written for dk weight yarn.\r\nbut, you can also use fingering weight yarn held double to achieve this weight.\r\ni did this when knitting up the size large to test the pattern and used approx. 110 grams of fingering weight total for a mens us size 10. this is a great and fun way to use up some leftover bits of yarn and have a fun marled pair of scrappy socks!\r\nor grab two fingering weight skeins out of your\r\nstash and use them up. so many fun stash busting possibilities when holding fingering weight double for these socks!\r\n\r\n*please keep in mind that for larger feet you may use more than 100 grams of dk weight for a pair. you can also do a shorter leg (shortie socks too!) to use less yarn and have more for the foot. \r\ni have a video on shorties here: https://youtu.be/obaxuannyyi , the same would apply to how to do them for these socks. just whatever length cuff and leg you want. have fun and experiment! :slightly_smiling_face: \r\n \r\n**supplies list**\r\n100 grams of dk weight yarn\r\nsample knit in\r\nmandi’s makings on her dk weight base in the colorway daydreamin. 75% superwash ◊ merino 25% nylon\r\nfull skein: 100 grams/245 yards\r\n\r\n**needles**\r\nus 3/3.25mm\r\nyour choice: dpns, magic loop using a 32” cable, 9” circular. pattern is not written for a specific way of working in the round.\r\n\r\n**notions**\r\nstitch marker\r\ntapestry needle for weaving in ends\r\n\r\n**gauge**\r\napprox 7 sts per inch in stockinette.\r\n",
