    "content": "this blanket is clearly influenced by my love for the nintendo video game series the legend of zelda the beautiful triangular motif is unmistakably the triforce of power courage and wisdom the unity of the hero link princess zelda and their battle against the evil ganondorf i designed and crocheted this blanket for my youngest son who was born in 2016 though i did make this for him i wanted it to be a reflection of something that i adored and wanted to share with him i wanted it to be simple but catching the magnificent shade of green yarn i choose is definitely catching but not overly powering it s the perfect shade of green for a boy especially one who i can envision raising to be an adventurer and saver of worlds like link i love the patterned arrangement of the triangles and feel like it came together beautifully for a fun and easy stitch pattern this blanket has withstood the test of time as well several years later and it hasn t pilled stretched faded or been torn even through all the washes it s still so soft i hope your little adventurer will enjoy this blanket as much as mine does"
