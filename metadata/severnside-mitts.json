  "notes": "**pattern or download support?** - please send a private message or personal email, as i can’t respond to comments.\r\n\r\nsevernside mitts, is a design inspired by the beauty of the river severn, which flows near the edge of the forest where i live. this pattern is part of the severnside set, which also includes a matching beanie. reflecting the river's ever-changing views, the mitts feature a cable motif that mimics its winding path. delicate seed stitch details add texture and depth to the motif, while columns of twisted stitches frame the design, symbolising the steady banks that guide the river.\r\n\r\nworked in the round from the cuff up, beginning with a snug\r\nribbed cuff that ensures a comfortable fit. as you knit, i hope you'll enjoy the flow of the cables, a meditative process that mirrors the calming influence of the river. pair the severnside mitts with the severnside beanie for a coordinated look that brings the magic of the river into your knitting. this set is sure to become a cherished addition to your winter wardrobe.\r\n\r\nsizes: 1 (2, 3)\r\n\r\nhand circumference: 17.5 (19.5, 21) cm [6.75 (7.75, 8.25)”]\r\ntotal length with cuff folded: 21 (23, 25) cm [8.5 (9, 9.75)”]\r\n\r\nneedles: size 3 mm (us 2.5) circular needles, 80 cm/32” for magic loop or double-pointed needles. cable needle if not using the ‘no cable needle’ method \r\n\r\n\r\nnotions: sewing needle, stitch markers, waste yarn\r\n\r\ngauge:  24.5 sts x 34 rnds = 10 cm/4” in stockinette stitch \r\n26-st cable = 8.4 cm [3.3”] \r\nmake sure to swatch before you begin. meeting the round gauge is particularly important to avoid making a mitt that is too short for your hand.  \r\ntip: if you know you have a tight gauge, consider going up a needle size after the ribbed cuff.\r\n\r\nyarn: annabel williams perendale dk (dk weight, 100% wool, 245m/268 yds per 100g/3.5oz skein) 1 (1, 1) skein. or approx. 146 (174, 208) m / 160 (190, 227) yds of dk weight yarn. maroon sample in colourway \"woodland\". dark green sample in \"severnside\".\r\n\r\nvideo tutorials for the cables are available in the pattern. \r\n\r\nthis pattern is available for free on sign up. future patterns are shared with subscribers as they are released. if you’d like access to additional patterns from my collection, they are available via a contribution through ko-fi: [https://ko-fi.com/annabelwilliamsyarn][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://ko-fi.com/annabelwilliamsyarn"
