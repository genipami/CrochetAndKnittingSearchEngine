    "content": "this pattern is really quick and easy perfect for beginners since potholders will come into contact with hot things i recommend using **natural fibers** cotton or wool acrylic runs the risk of melting if you find your circle isn t laying flat change your hook size -if it s curving up into a bowl-shape use a **larger** hook -if there s a big wrinkle like there s too much fabric when you try to lay it flat use a **smaller** hook size"
