  "notes": "100% soft’s dumpster fire vinyl figure has been heralded as the mascot for 2020. now you can crochet your very own piece of super cute hot garbage. it’s squishy. it’s adorable. it’s where all your hopes and dreams burst into flames.\r\n\r\nthe crochet bits are easy to execute, but there is a good amount of sewing and fussy assembly. need some more assistance? i made a youtube tutorial for you as well. that video is public, but i included the link in the pdf for convenience. \r\n\r\ni used paintbox cotton aran weight and a g/4.0mm crochet hook, but any worsted weight yarn will work!\r\n\r\nif you’re feeling fancy, you can make the flames removable and stick other things in your crocheted dumpster, like goals you never achieved, or all the things that have ever disappointed you. or candy. i leave that up to you and your imagination.\r\n\r\ndumpster fire used with permission by 100% soft llc. this pattern is for personal use only. please do not distribute it in part or in whole, and please do not sell finished items you make from this pattern. thank you!\r\n"
