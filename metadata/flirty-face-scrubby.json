  "notes": "**this is a pay what you want pattern! use the code flirty50 for 50% off the original price or use the code flirty100 for a free copy. if you download for free, i’d love it if you gave this pattern a ❤️. thank you for your support!\r\n\r\nthe *flirty face scrubby* is a beginner-friendly crochet design that blends functionality with a touch of elegance. worked in a simple stitch pattern, it creates a faint ribbed texture that feels soft and gentle on the skin, making it perfect for everyday cleansing. the design is finished with a delicate edging reminiscent of flower petals, giving each scrubby a graceful, handcrafted charm. quick to make and enjoyable for all skill levels, this project is ideal for personal use, thoughtful handmade gifts, or adding a beautiful and practical item to your market inventory.\r\n\r\nthis pattern uses dk weight yarn and a 4.5 mm hook. for scrubbies, i recommend a synthetic or plant-based fiber, as they tend to be more durable and easier to care for. this scrubby is worked in the round using primarily half double crochet stitches, with a ribbed texture. it’s finished with a delicate shell border that gives it a decorative touch. in all of my samples, i feature a small loop that is practical for hanging it in your bathroom. that is optional, but included in the pattern.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is written for one size, but it is so easy to customize! if you'd like to adjust the size, feel free to experiment with different hook sizes, yarn weights, or an extra round or two. gauge is not crucial in this pattern.\r\n\r\nthis is a beginner-friendly project that uses simple stitches and techniques. video tutorials will be provided for all the special stitches to help guide you through the process.\r\n\r\ni want to say a huge thank you to my amazing testers [handmadeknitwear](/people/handmadeknitwear), [fiaknit](/people/fiaknit), [dawnlambert88](/people/dawnlambert88), [maylina](/people/maylina), [larnie60](/people/larnie60), [divavonpurl](/people/divavonpurl), [tomato68evony](/people/tomato68evony)! without you this pattern wouldn’t be possible.\r\n\r\nthank you for choosing my pattern, i hope you enjoyed it. if you enjoyed this pattern, you may be interested in some of my other patterns–you can check them out [here][1] :) you may sell as many of the finished items as you wish, but if you share on social media, please give me credit @elly donner on ravelry and link the pattern to its source. if you have any questions or need pattern support, please contact me [here][2] @stopitharry on ravelry. i appreciate your support!\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/designers/elly-donner\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/people/stopitharry"
