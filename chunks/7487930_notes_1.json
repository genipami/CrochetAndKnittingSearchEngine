    "content": "this neck scarf is inspired by the classic silk square scarfs that look *oh so chique* and make every outfit look so much more elevated it s also a super quick knit perfect for in between big projects or as an easy project on the side for car rides this would also make a cute and affordable present since it uses very minimal yarn less than one ball each the scarf has points that widen then come in for the part where you tie the knot so it s not super bulky and then increase again to the original width for the part that goes around your neck the icord edges that are knit simultaneously give it a polished look it s knit in a super easy to remember lace pattern that gives the scarf a cottage core look"
