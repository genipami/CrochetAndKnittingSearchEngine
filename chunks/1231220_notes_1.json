    "content": "the buddy wrist warmers pattern is a companion pattern to my diversion scarf 1 and uses yarn left over from that project i ve also used the same offset linen stitch because i love it these colourful wrist warmers work up very quickly especially if you decide to make them in a single colour and omit the closure the little closure is my favourite part though borrowed from my mighty fine day bag it looks like a little cat paw or dog paw i know a lot of us have a furry friend in our lives and my sentimental heart liked the thought of carrying a nod to this love around on my wrists as i go out and about the buttons were salvaged from a cushion our dog buddy kindly tore to pieces yesterday and they are the perfect sentimental addition it is worth noting that these wrist warmers use about **12g of yarn each 2g of each colour ** so they are perfect for using up scraps of yarn enjoy dedri 1 https //www ravelry com/patterns/library/diversion-scarf"
