    "content": "there s loads of wonderful sock patterns out there but i really wanted to record a formula for socks that can be used for pretty much any yarn/hook combination i also wanted the socks to have short-row heels because they re neat and simple finally i wanted the socks to be worked in extended single_crochet because it s thin and smooth and stretchy for crochet hence the quokka socks pattern i named them for the cute little marsupials that only live here in western australia - famously on a small island off the coast where roger federer took a selfie with some of them last year i have made these socks in yarns ranging in weight from the sock weight not just socks with a 2 5mm hook at a gauge of 7 stitches per inch spi up to the bulky weight denim effects with a 5 5mm hook at a gauge of 3 3 stitches per inch you can however use the pattern with almost any yarn/hook combination with a little bit of maths my calculations/workings for the sock weight yarn are shown throughout the pattern see my project notes for details of other yarn/hook/size combinations thanks heaps to my lovely testers melissa christine and valda for their effort and feedback much appreciated i hope you enjoy making these socks please contact me if you have any questions - i m happy to help susan"
