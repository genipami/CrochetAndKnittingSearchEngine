    "content": "this scarf was inspired by the sea witch in seanan mcguire s october daye series specifically the one time she shapeshifts into an octopus the luidaeg remains my favourite despite not being the main character it s knit flat and in one piece including the bobbles while technically one size it can come out larger or smaller depending on what yarn you choose to use **materials ** * suggested yarn red heart gemstone 1 ball 312 yds / 285 m * yarn weight bulky 5 * needle size us 8 5 0 mm * gauge 18 sts 24 row = 4in/10cm in stockinette it should create a somewhat dense fabric * other blocking surface and pins required a stitch counter and/or locking stitch markers are recommended to track row with the recommended yarn my scarves came out to about 76 in 193 cm long and 9 in 23 cm wide with a finer dk weight yarn caron skinny cakes in particular the resulting scarf was 60 inches long and 8 inches across i tend to use needles that are 1mm smaller than recommended on the yarn label but this is optional you may just end up with a more open fabric the yarn i used has a label gauge of 14 sts x 19 row but with 5mm needles instead of 6mm the gauge becomes 18 sts x 24 row **blocking notes** hi y all it s been brought to my attention that i didn t really explain how blocking works with the bobbles or how to fix the bump in the edge at the middle of the scarf **for the bump ** i got rid of that by gently getting the scarf damp only a little to make it easier to work with then stretching and pinning it out until i was satisfied with the shape as i mainly used acrylic yarns for mine i then applied steam if you re using wool you can steam or use a wet blocking technique but yeah that gets rid of the bump in the middle and you can make the ends a bit more spiral-y if desired **for the bobbles ** if you re steam blocking shape the bobble into a sucker and apply steam wait until it s cooled down just enough to touch and adjust the shape as needed apply steam again i did my bobbles this way and they ve stayed quite well alternatively you can use a marble to keep the centers in if you have some around as well as some kind of support around the edge of the bobble to keep it from flattening too much this method comes from the project notes of someone who made a scarf and would also work well for wet blocking though that would require more marbles and/or supports i hope this helps happy knitting"
