    "content": "these easy double-thick crochet potholders are a quick and easy project you ll love to crochet over and over again i learned this particular crochet pattern from my grandma who makes them all the time but you may have seen similar crochet hot pad and trivet patterns called something like the magic potholder pattern or the origami hot pad pattern this potholder pattern uses a simple combination of basic crochet stitches so it s easy to learn and quick to make and since the potholders are made out of cotton yarn they re durable and machine washable **size** 7 in by 7 in square potholder you can make a larger or smaller potholder by making a longer or shorter starting chain **gauge** 15 sts and 10 row = 4 in meeting gauge is not critical unless you want to make a specific size potholder i will say though that you want to crochet a tight enough gauge to get thick dense fabric"
