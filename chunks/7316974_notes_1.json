    "content": "super bulky yarn and garter stitch make this hat mega squishy and super quick to knit up this makes it a great option for a last minute warm accessory knit for yourself or for a gift worked sideways in wedges the crown is shaped using short row but because of the garter stitch base there s no need to pick up the wraps making it a good fit for an introduction to short row feel free to mix and match the circumference size number of wedges worked and the height size number of stitches cast on for example you may work the middle-size height by casting on 23 stitches along with the largest circumference by repeating the wedges three times"
