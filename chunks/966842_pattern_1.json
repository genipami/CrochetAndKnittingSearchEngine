    "content": "sweet pineapple wrap this triangular shawl is shallow to maximize your wearing options it s worked from the bottom up and has built in borders i like working triangular shawls from the bottom up because i m just not keen on chaining a mile then decreasing down to the tip with its possibility of running out of yarn i also prefer not to add borders on afterwards if possible so that when you re done you re really done i really like this easy pineapple stitch and used it to make the pineapple grocery bag a free pattern in my ravelry store it s easy to execute and memorize and creates a lovely light and airy fabric i ve made sure that all of the chains in the main body are the same length 4 and that only the chain arches just before the side borders as well as those forming part of the actual pineapple motif are shorter 3 the pineapple motifs are 6 row high and are nested as is usual so that you start a new pineapple on each side every 3 row i hope you enjoy making this piece and i look forward to seeing your projects on ravelry \uf04a 1 4 page of materials the shawl looks great in yarn weights from lace to bulky just chose a hook that gives you the fabric you like the lime green sweet pineapple wrap pictured here is made in fingering weight 4 ply aus acrylic yarn with a 3mm hook see the pattern page on ravelry for finer and bulkier versions size/measurements width of long edge = 140cm/54 depth = 46cm/18 you can really make this piece whatever size you like but you ll have more options for wearing it if you carry on working until your top edge is at least the distance between your fingertips when your arms are held out to the side your wingspan gauge gauge is not critical for this project just choose a hook small enough to give you good stitch definition but large enough for a soft fabric notes standard american terminology is used the shawl is bordered on each side of every row by a column of shells which are worked as you go at the start of each row 1 slip_stitch into ch2 space at the centre of the shell 2 start-shell = ch3 dc1 ch2 dc2 at the end of each row 1 end-shell = dc2 ch2 dc2 2 ch1 turn all of the chain arches between the pineapple motifs in the body of the shawl are ch4 except those adjacent to the shells at the edges which are ch3 each pineapple motif is 6 row high a new pineapple is started on each side every 3 row and that s how the shawl expands to form a shallow triangle 2 4 page of instructions foundation create a magic_ring r1 start-shell ch2 end-shell all into the magic_ring ch1 turn at the start of each row from now"
