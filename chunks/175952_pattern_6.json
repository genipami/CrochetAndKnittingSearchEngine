    "content": "away you won t need any a markers if you d like to make a v-neck cast on just as is described on page 5 but work the neck front differently instead of increasing the front every other row increase at the beginning and end of every 4 to 6 row until all the front stitches have been added join and continue knitting in the round as for the crew neck you can create stand-up collars fold-over collars or very minimal collars you could even just crochet an edge on the neck opening to keep the sweater sweet and simple cardigans if you d like to make a cardigan instead of a pullover there are two methods you can choose from 1 add 6 extra stitches to the center front of the neck when you complete the neck shaping and join just as you would for the pullover work these 6 stitches in seed stitch to form a steek down the front of the sweater continue the steek all the way down through to the bottom hem after the knitting is complete sew on either side of the center of the steek with a sewing machine using a straight stitch then cut between the sewing lines this is not for the faint of heart fold the steek to the inside of the sweater and sew it down with yarn sew in a zipper leave the edges plain or pick up the edge stitches and knit up a button band as desired 2 do not join after the neck is complete but continue to work back and forth for the entire sweater thus leaving the front open sew in a zipper leave the edges plain or pick up the edge stitches and knit up a button band as desired colors and textures raglan sweaters lend themselves particularly well to horizontal striping as the stripes automatically line up across the raglan and you don t have to worry about matching up stripes because you re knitting this in the round seamlessly this presents an ideal opportunity to use up yarn left over from other projects just make sure that all the yarn knits to about the same gauge the pattern is written with the intent of creating a very plain stockinette stitch sweater consider it a blank canvas to try cables stitch patterns with lots of texture ribbing whatever you want just remember to document your first sleeve so that you know how to get the second one just right and more importantly have fun images are \u00a9 at my mother s knee this is for personal and non-profit use only page 7"
