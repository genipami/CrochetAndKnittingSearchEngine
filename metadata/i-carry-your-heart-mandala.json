  "notes": "i am delighted to end 2022 with this design, which has been a long time in the making and is very dear to me.  it is, in fact, the most emotional of all my designs.\r\n\r\nthis design takes its name and its meaning from the poem by e.e.cummings, but it was inspired by (and is dedicated to) my sister's two angel babies, eve (pronounced evie) and sam, and her rainbow baby greyson.\r\n\r\n**i will be sharing this pattern on my website in 3 weekly parts, starting 31/12/2022 with the information post (link provided) and the heart motif:  eve's heart.**\r\n\r\nonce i have shared all three parts, i will publish a paid, ad-free pdf version of the pattern as well.\r\n\r\nthe mandala is created by crocheting four hearts (part 1) and joining them together (part 2) before growing them in the round (parts 2 and 3). \r\n\r\nfor now, that is where the journey will end.  behind the scenes, however, i have plans for growing this beauty into a full-sized blanket.  \r\n\r\ni have provided written instructions and photos.  hopefully we will be able to add diagrams/charts and video tutorials soon.\r\n\r\nhappy new year!\r\n\r\ndedri"
