    "content": "this scarf was inspired by iris schreirer s knit version from handknit holidays melanie falick s book through stc craft after requests from crocheters in my lys for a crocheted version i began work on figuring out how to make this in crochet this is a fun and fast crochet project - a perfect last-minute gift **important note ** due to the way the scarf is constructed you should be careful with yarn substitution if you want to use a different yarn for your scarf choose one with a low degree of twist overspun yarns like silk garden might result in a wavy scarf which is totally cool just so long as you wanted it to be wavy you ll know if the yarn is overspun because it will kink up and twist back on itself you can also ask the lys staff for other low-spun yarns like jasper from berroco this scarf will tend to be wavy while you re working on it but will straighten out once it is blocked oct 2009 - the pattern has been updated to include step-by-step photos and a handwritten chart"
