    "content": "this simple textured stitch pattern adds interest to the knitting and looks great worked in either a solid or variegated yarn the pattern was inspired by a hat my friend lynn spotted in a duluth trading company catalog she had a skein of malabrigo arroyo in mind so i wrote the pattern for a sport weight gauge special thanks to laurel dormaier for careful test knitting"
