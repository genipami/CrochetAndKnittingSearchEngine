    "content": "way to coax your garment into the shape you want when the yarn is washable i wet block nearly everything i crochet whether it looks like it needs it or not completely immerse the piece in a sink of cool water without wringing or twisting i add a tiny drop of lavender scented or other sweet- smelling shampoo or body wash to the water not enough to suds up or need additional rinsing if you want you can use products made for this purpose allow the water to drain out the next part is tricky and you gotta have a washing machine close by gather up the piece in a big towel and dash to your washing machine the lid of which is already flipped open to expedite the process put the garment in the machine and run a short spin only cycle this will not agitate or stretch the yarn only spin out the excess water if you don t have a separate short spin cycle you can manually stop the spinning when you no longer hear the swishing of water if you don t have a machine handy roll up the piece in dry towels and press out as much water as you can take the damp piece and spread it out on another big towel on a flat surface gently but insistently pull pat and prod your garment into the shape you want measuring against the pattern schematics or finished measurements given i never feel the need to pin or otherwise nail down my crochet but feel free to do this if you want allow to dry completely yarns react differently to this process most wools will stretch horribly with blocking but when dry they sometimes do and sometimes don t shrink back so avoid stretching wools too much cotton also can stretch when wet but most will dry nicely to shape one yarn that scares me is bamboo some bamboo yarns will seize and shrink when wet yikes but most will relax back when dry most acrylic yarns remain the same wet and dry and it often seems a waste of time to block but i do anyway page 14 djc all shawl \u00a9 2008 2010 by doris chan all rights reserved djc designs the crochet pattern line from doris chan making the all shawl all yours just do it with your choice of yarn and appropriate hook you can make your perfect personal shawl often our decisions are dictated by the amount of yarn on hand been there more times than i care to admit why oh why didn t i get the extra balls when i had the chance you learn to be flexible so dig deep into your yarn stash for some cool yarns search your stitch guides or favorite lace pattern books for a brilliant edging to explode go go go how much yarn here are some jumping off places for substituting yarns suggesting approximate amounts to get an approximately 25 back"
