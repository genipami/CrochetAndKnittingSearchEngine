  "notes": "quick and easy heart motif.\r\n\r\ni designed this little heart when i heard about a project to gift covid-19 patients a heart, and also give their families an identical one, so although the family cannot visit or see their loved one in hospital or at their time of passing, their heart will always be with them. \r\n\r\nthe original version of the pattern was written for three bears affection aran yarn and a 4mm hook, and the finished hearts measured 9 x 8 cm.\r\n\r\nhowever i then heard that hearts should ideally measure no more than 7cm, so i have added another version using dk/light worsted yarn and a 3.5mm hook.\r\n\r\nthis new dk version is also available in us terms.\r\n\r\nthe pattern has not been tested, so please let me know if you find any mistakes. the quickest way to get a response is to join my fb group rosina crochets and post your query there https://www.facebook.com/groups/rosinacrochets/"
