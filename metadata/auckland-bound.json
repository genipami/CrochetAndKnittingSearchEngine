  "notes": "this hat is quite special to me – it was designed during the first planning stages of a (hopeful!) family trip abroad, and each stitch was made with the excitement and anticipation of this journey. it was designed with an adventurer’s spirit, and with this free pattern i hope to pass this spirit along to other knitters.\r\n\r\nthe body of this hat is knit in a simple broken rib stitch, and it features a favorite method of mine – the folded brim. using a provisional co, sts from the co edge are later picked up to create a permanently folded brim that is both flexible and extra-toasty.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n**dimensions**:  17.5 (20, 22.5)” circumference hat body\r\n\r\n* i recommend knitting a size down if you are between sizes, it can be quite stretchy\r\n\r\n**needles**:\r\n\r\n* size us 3/3.25 mm 16” circular knitting needles\r\n\r\n* size us 5/3.75 mm 16” circular knitting needles\r\n\r\n* (optional) size us 3 or smaller circular knitting needles, any length\r\n\r\n**notions**:\r\n\r\n* four stitch markers (including one unique for bor)\r\n\r\n* small bit of waste yarn\r\n\r\n* tapestry needle\r\n\r\n**yarn**: \r\n\r\n215 (230, 245) yds/195 (210, 225) m mc\r\n\r\n* orange sample used hedgehog fibres merino dk in colorway monarch ([sample page here][1])\r\n\r\n* red sample used the plucky knitter cozy in colorway antiqued ([sample page here][2])\r\n\r\n**gauge**: 24 sts x 34 rows = 4” x 4” broken rib stitch, worked in the round on larger needles across an even number of stitches:\r\n\r\n* round 1: knit\r\n\r\n* round 2: *k1 p1* around\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/projects/moemr/auckland-bound-i\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/projects/moemr/auckland-bound-ii",
