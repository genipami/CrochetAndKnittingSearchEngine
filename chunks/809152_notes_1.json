    "content": "the crochet toy box baby blanket is perfect for beginners of crochet i say this because the yarn has very long stripes of one colour before switching to another as a newbie crocheter i had trouble dealing with changing colours so if you don t mind the random look of where the colour changes you can blaze through the ball and let the yarn change the colour on it s own this blanket takes 3 hours or less for experienced crocheters easy not much thinking and get er done"
