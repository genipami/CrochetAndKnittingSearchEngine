  "notes": "these hand warmers have been my all time most popular item at craft fairs, and requested for gifts from my family and friends. i own 6 or 7 pair myself, and i love to wear them with magic stretch gloves in the winter  there are several pictures in the pattern to help you along the way. i have added a whole bunch of the ones i have made, have for sale etc to spark creativity!"
