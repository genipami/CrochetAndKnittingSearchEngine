    "content": "very easy to adjust the pattern if you wish to add stripes or you can get creative with the drawstring and use an alternate color or even a different material cording like leather looks great in solid colors or with self-striping or variegated yarn this dice bag pattern as written can hold up to 100 standard-sized dice you can make it shorter for fewer dice or add a round to the bottom circle for a bigger wider bag it is very versatile any player knows you can never have too much dice and because this pattern is so quick and easy to make you can even work on it while playing you can make one for each character s sets of dice 4 wide x 6 tall as written this is also the same pattern i used for my set of resin runes instructions for creating a bag sized for runes are included"
