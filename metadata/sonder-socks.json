  "notes": "sonder socks is a basic cuff-down sock recipe that provides instructions for incorporating contrast heels and toes using your favourite mini-skeins. \r\n\r\nit also includes directions for two different rib treatments at the cuff as well as options for working the leg and top of foot in stockinette or in a simple 3 x 1 rib. \r\n\r\nwhether you're a beginner or more experienced sock knitter, this pattern makes a great canvas for playing with colour or even trying out your own stitch and texture ideas to create your own unique design!\r\n\r\n*note that a basic cast on calculation along with toe-shaping information by shoe size makes it easy to adapt this pattern to your knitting gauge and foot size.*\r\n\r\n**find sonder sock sets** [here][1].\r\n**find sonder yak sock sets** [here][2].\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://sonderyarnco.com/products/sonder-sock-sets?variant=42446746845429\r\n  [2]: https://sonderyarnco.com/products/sonder-yak-sock-sets?variant=42446822179061",
