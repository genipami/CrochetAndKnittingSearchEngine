  "notes": "inspired by the cute little hens you can raise on your farm in the game stardew valley, i designed this pattern to make my own chickens! it's somewhat intermediate since there's some fiddly bits, but it's pretty straightforward.\r\n\r\nfinished chickens are about 4\" tall, depending on your tension and such.\r\n\r\nmaterials needed:\r\nworsted weight acrylic yarn, in body colour (cream or tan), yellow, and red\r\n3.0mm and 3.5mm hooks\r\n8mm safety eyes (black)\r\nstuffing"
