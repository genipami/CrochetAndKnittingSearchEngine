  "notes": "romantic, lacy and feminine - the dewdrop wrap is the perfect shawl for any season! the mesh arches give the wrap an open airy look while the optional scalloped border adds a vintage touch. \r\n\r\nalthough the design looks intricate, this crochet wrap it a lot easier to make than it seems. chains and double crochets make up 99% of this easy wrap (with single crochets making up the last 1%) and the pattern follows a four row repeat so you can extend it to any length you want! this simple and versatile project would also make a great mother’s day gift.\r\n\r\nthis pattern is also accompanied by a video tutorial :slightly_smiling_face: \r\n\r\nsizes: one size (with alteration instructions)\r\n\r\nskill level: beginner\r\n\r\nthis pattern is written in english using us crochet terms. contains step-by-step instructions with pictures. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsign up to my **[newsletter][2]** and never miss a new crochet pattern release!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  [2]: https://view.flodesk.com/pages/5ebf67c2ab499000265d1ad4"
