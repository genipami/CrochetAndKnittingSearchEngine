  "notes": "looking for a project that's quick, fun, and just a little bit addictive? **meet the wheat stitch™ crochet chickens!** these adorable chickens work up fast and come in two sizes — small and large — perfect for starting your own little crochet flock. you can use any yarn you have lying around (gauge isn’t a big deal here!), and the body is made with the beautiful, textured wheat stitch that everyone’s loving right now. whether you make just one or find yourself hooked and making a whole coop full, these chickens are sure to bring a smile!\r\n\r\nmaking your chicken is easy-peasy. first, we’ll make the body using the wheat stitch™ in joined and turned rounds. then, we’ll crochet the extra details (comb and tail feathers). we’ll add eyes (the pattern calls for safety eyes, but always remember that they aren’t recommended for young children) and a simple beak, and finish by sewing the top closed, attaching the comb and feathers as we go.\r\n\r\n[a video tutorial is included with the pattern.][1]\r\n\r\ncrochet hook: \r\n[g+/7 (4.50mm) - or size to meet gauge][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nnotions:\r\n[removable stitch markers][3]\r\n[yarn needle to weave in ends][4]\r\n[scissors][5]\r\n[fiber fill][6]\r\n[safety eyes][7]\r\n[string (for adding printed tags)][8]\r\n[poly craft pellets][9]\r\n\r\nyarn:\r\n[herrschners worsted 8][10]\r\n100% acrylic; 489yds/226g\r\n\r\nyardage:\r\nwill depend on preferred size and yarn/hook.\r\nas written: 80 (210)yds\r\n\r\nyarn substitutions:\r\n[brava worsted][11]\r\n100% premium acrylic, 218yds/100g\r\n\r\n[herrschners worsted 8 heathers][12]\r\n100% acrylic, 489yds/226g\r\n\r\n[dishie][13]\r\n100% cotton, 190yds/100g\r\n\r\nabbreviations:\r\nblo - back loop only\r\nch(s) - chain(s)\r\nflo - front loop only\r\nrs - right side\r\nsc - single crochet\r\nsc2tog - single crochet two together\r\nsl st - slip stitch\r\nst(s) - stitch(es)\r\nws - wrong side\r\n\r\ngauge:\r\n sts and  rows = 4\" by 4\"; not critical for this pattern\r\n\r\nnot sure what gauge is?
