    "content": "this seaside blanket was inspired by the beaches of my youth mossel bay and muizenberg south africa which both had gorgeous beach huts this inspiration was fueled into flame on our recent trip to swanage jurassic coast uk i love the seaside it energizes and calms me in equal measures i hope this blanket can convey that to you along with a sense of nostalgia and whimsy the blanket is made using 2 strands of double knit yarn held together and a 5 5 mm crochet hook once you get past the beach huts the wave pattern is rhythmical and calm without being boring enjoy dedri"
