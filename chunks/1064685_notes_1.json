    "content": "most cro-hook patterns you will find are worked with color reversibility the ability to make two different fabrics seems to have been overlooked as you can see with this scarf rather than one color on each side there are two distinctly different sides each just as beautiful as the other i love that i can get two looks from the same scarf and this technique makes it easy >this pattern is available for free at crochetkim com or by purchasing an ad-free print-ready version here click visit pattern website above or the link for more information below to see the free version"
