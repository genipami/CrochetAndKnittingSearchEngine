  "notes": "reading, or crocheting for that matter, often requires wearing a shawl to keep us warm, but the\r\npointy shape of a normal triangular shawl does not keep our backs warm. this reading shawl was\r\ndesigned to cover the whole of the back without holes in the fabric making it extra warm and a\r\nsimple design on the front to make it pretty. there are no tassels for practical reasons, making it\r\nthe ideal shawl to create and wear during those long winter nights when we are reading or\r\ncrocheting in bed or on the sofa."
