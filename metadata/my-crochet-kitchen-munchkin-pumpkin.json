  "notes": "growing pumpkins is one of my highlights of the summer – and\r\nharvesting them in autumn is even better!\r\n\r\nthese little munchkins are such a cute variety and are perfect for decorating the house (before making their way to the oven).\r\n\r\nthis is a beginner-friendly pattern that’s quick as well as easy to make.\r\n\r\nit’s worked in continuous rounds, shaped and then the stem is crocheted separately before attaching.\r\n\r\nyou’ll also find a stitch guide included to help you with the particular stitches used throughout this pattern, and to grow your amigurumi skills!\r\n\r\nyou could try making multiple pumpkins in a range of different autumnal shades, or add some natural variation to the height by adding a few rounds of xs all round.",
