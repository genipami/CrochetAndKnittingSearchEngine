    "content": "the double slip sock recipe is designed to be used with your own favourite vanilla sock recipe or pattern it is perfect for adding interest to self-striping yarn with dual columns down each side of the foot it has a simple 4 row pattern repeat which means it s terrific for tv and travel knitting if you re like me and even counting 4 row at the end of the day seems too much then just use a row counter ***please note this is not a full sock pattern and prior knowledge of how to knit a top down sock is assumed whilst written for a 64 stitch sock the pattern can be adjusted for various size socks by changing the number of knit stitches between the columns using 4ply/fingering weight yarn with an odd number of row for each stripe repeat will produce the most effective use of the pattern as the slip stitches will travel into the colour below but any self striping yarn will look great you could also try a plain or a lightly speckled yarn as these could also show off the slip stitches beautifully the example shown uses halfbaked hand dyed aussie sock self striping in the colour conway"
