  "notes": "here’s a handy embellishment. this little, lacy maple leaf is a perfect decorative motif, but you can also make it in thicker yarn to be a coaster or thread to use as jewelry or an ornament. while there are lots of maple leaf patterns out there, this one is more open to reduce the required yardage. i made this pattern specifically so that it could be made using less than one hank of embroidery floss. these leaves are easy and fun to make and only take a few minutes to whip up. it’s hard to stop at just one!\r\n\r\nsamples pictured:\r\n\r\n1. earrings made with size 20 crochet thread and a 0.75 mm steel hook. the leaves each came out about 1 inch across.\r\n\r\n2. decorations/appliques made with embroidery floss and a us size b (2.25 mm) hook.\r\n\r\n3. coasters made with worsted weight cotton and a us size h (5 mm) hook. those came out about 5 inches across."
