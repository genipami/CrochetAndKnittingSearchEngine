  "notes": "remember my first iphone pocket chic ribbed blsc phone pocket holder? \r\n\r\nhere is one that’s ever easier and quicker to make, and will fit any phone you have. although it’s not as stretchy as the original, it’s looser, thicker stitches will work up much quicker, and give it a beautiful, ridged texture. \r\n\r\nthis mobile cozy  is perfect for busy parents, students, and older adults—it’s quick to make and super easy to attach or detach from any bag, backpack strap, stroller handle, or walking aid.\r\n\r\n"
