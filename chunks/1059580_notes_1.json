    "content": "these socks were inspired by a gap in my wardrobe and in my knitting bag first i love wearing handknit socks year-round but most of my socks are mid-calf length and too warm for summer days so clearly i needed to make a few more pairs of ankle socks second although plain stockinette socks are just fine often i want something a little more entertaining to knit nothing too difficult just a simple stitch pattern that s easy to memorize and makes the knitting seem to go faster the eyelet pattern i chose for these socks has the added benefit of providing some fresh air on those warm days though the instructions are written specifically for ankle socks the cuff and leg can easily be lengthened to make mid-calf socks if desired the socks are worked from the top down with a heel flap and gusset construction three different options for toe shaping are provided three sizes are given to fit most adult feet if you re sharing progress or fo photos on instagram please tag them with #freshairsocks - i love to see what you re making this pattern contains both written and charted instructions tech edited by lisa beth houchins 3 thanks to anne and little skein 4 for yarn support and so much more 3 https //meanestmommyknits com 4 https //www littleskein com"
