    "content": "you want the bangs to be and how many row it will take you to decrease back down the models in this pattern have bangs that are 8 stitches wide i e 8 new stitches so 16 row then i knit for 7 row before decreasing back down for a total of 39 row i stopped knitting the non-bang side at row 19 you could add more stitches to make the bangs wider just keep those extra row in mind when calculating when to stop knitting the non-bang side decrease back down on every rs k2tog at end before edging to decrease bangs back down until side with bangs is back to 29 stitches and you ve removed all the added stitches join at side part if needed work one more row so the yarn is at the front of the wig use 3 needle bind off to seam against the other side 29 stitches on each needle this is sort of a comb over situation xd back of head seam up the hole so it goes across the back of the head the live stitches should be seamed against the side of the comb over if you started the 3 needle bind off at the front of the wig as recommended you will have the yarn available to keep seaming since you should have 20 stitches on the side of the combover and 39 stitches on the back of the head you will also need to decrease the back section as you graft so insert the needle along the combover edge then k2tog on the back edge then bring the stitch through back onto the needle psso to bind off that stitch hope that makes sense it helps a lot to use a crochet hook as your 3rd needle back of head gathered side part now the only thing left is to weave in all ends and put on your fabulous new wig"
