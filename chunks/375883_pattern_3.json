    "content": "the middle finger is going to be the first finger you do hence the funny because yes i m apparently 12 years old single_crochet in the spiral until you re 2 rounds from the fingertip then decrease in the spiral until the opening is too small to bother with cut yarn leaving a good long tail--this will be used to close any remaining hole and to weave in alternatively only do the fingers for 5-8 rounds to make half-fingered mitts to do the rest of the fingers you ll have to join yarn at the base of the finger and single_crochet around in the spiral similar to the middle finger when you come to the corner of the finger where the chain that created the finger divide meets the rest of the stitches you will need to decrease otherwise the finger will most likely be too loose and floppy after you ve done your first round or two of single_crochet try the glove on to make sure the finger opening isn t too tight if it is rip back to your first round and increase in one or two places or undo a corner decrease to loosen the opening now to save yourself some end weaving you can always single_crochet over the tail of the yarn where you joined but i do caution you to keep this tail loose otherwise the finger can seem tight when really there are plenty of stitches there and if you increase when it s not necessary your glove will have big puffy fingers turn the glove inside out and weave in the ends note i found when i made these gloves that all of the fingers except the pinky required decreases at the corners on my glove the pinky was tight enough without the decreases but the ring index finger and thumb each required two decreases and the middle finger got 4\u2026 all decreases correspond with the number of corners and yes this will make sense when you re making the glove do all that one more time and you have a pair of gloves yes they re very simple and no-frills and not terribly decorative but they should get the job done also if you buy some conductive thread and work it into the fingertips you ll be able to work your smart phone or other touch screen device without taking your gloves off note if you are feeling adventurous you can use two colors of yarn to create the illusion of a certain hand shape in order to be more\u2026 expressive \uf0b7 islander or surfer relocated to colder climates do the cuff hand pinky and thumb in mc and index middle and ring fingers in cc to tell people hang loose \uf0b7 try the cuff hand index finger and pinky in mc and thumb middle and ring fingers in cc and rock on \uf0b7 do the cuff hand thumb index finger and pinky in mc and middle/ring fingers in cc and wordlessly"
