    "content": "either side of the gap together knit 1 wrap and turn see how the k2tog closes up the gap so nicely i haven t done the last k1 or the wrap and turn yet then do the same thing on the purl side purl until one stitch before the gap purl the two stitches on either side together purl 1 wrap and turn keep on repeating these two row \uf0b7 knit to 1 before the gap k2tog k1 w&t \uf0b7 purl to 1 before the gap p2tog k1 w&t you ll work more and more stitches each time you work a row when you get to a point where you can t do another full repeat of the pattern stop when you re back at the marker on the knit side your heel should look like this we re getting there your sock is looking sockier and sockier sockier sok-ee-er adj more like a sock 6 pick-up artist the next step is to do the set-up row for the foot part of the sock it s a little fiddly but not too difficult much like the rest of making socks and knitting in general so after turning the heel your sock should look like this i ve numbered the needles again for your reference knit to the end of needle 1 then still using needle 1 pick up and knit stitches equal to one quarter of your sock number from the side of your heel flap my sock number is 60 so i will pick up 15 stitches if you were careful with slipping the first stitch of each of your heel flap row you should actually have the proper number of spaces in which to pick up stitches it s hard to explain but once you try it it will make sense picking up stitches is just like knitting only you don t need live stitches to start with insert your needle where you want the stitch to go wrap the yarn around your needle just like you do when you knit and pull the stitch through if you haven t tried picking up stitches before this is a pretty good video tutorial when you get to the last picked-up stitch pick up both the usual slipped stitch as well as the stitch below and then knit it as normal this will prevent your sock from having a little hole on the side if you skip this step it s not a big deal but it makes a nicer finished product it s a little fiddly but it really makes the finished sock look better knit needles 2 and 3 normally then using your fifth needle and continuing in the same direction around your sock pick up and knit stitches on the remaining side of the flap remember to pick up 1/4 of your sock number of stitches just like with needle 1 if you want to do the fancy-pants no-holes pick-up like on needle 1 do it at"
