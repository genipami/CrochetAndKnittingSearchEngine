    "content": "fuzzy bodies this is very important the main reason i never wrote this pattern before now is that there are so many different types of fuzzy yarn there s eyelash fun fur and loads of thicker soft fuzzy stuff i don t like patterns that make you use a hard to find obsure or expensive yarn my personal favorite is bernat s frenzy but i m pretty sure it s discontinued and i can t find it anywhere anymore so for me to write the pattern to be used with frezy would be kinda mean and pointless plus i m cheap so if you want to make it with mohair or something go right ahead i ll buy 87 cent skeins of fun fur instead i won t use patterns that make me special order yarn so why should i make you /i so gauge is going to be very important as is the type of yarn you use if you use an eyelash or fun fur type yarn where the yarn is mainly fibers on a string lightweight not substantial carry your ww yarn along with it however if the fuzzy yarn you choose has bulk or is more substantial such as bernat s frenzy personal favorite or hobby lobby s paradox\u037e or has another yarn built in such as bernat s baby lash just use this yarn don t carry your ww with it in the pattern i m just going to say fuzzy yarn so for those who fall into the fibers on a string category this means both yarns and to those that fall into the substantial yarn category just use the fuzzy yarn and if i ve confused anyone too much with this send me an email and i ll do my best to help gauge ww yarn 5 stitches across=1 6 row=1 fuzzy yarn 7 stitches across=2 4 row=1 right now there is only the bear pattern but as i add on more animals you ll just look below for which animal you d like find the pieces you need in the patterns below then make and connect them animals for bear 1 5 oz ww yarn i like simply soft and an f hook or hook needed to obtain gauge 1 5 oz fuzzy yarn and g hook or hook needed to obtain gauge small piece of white felt embroidery thread or paint for face two eyes 8mm safety eyes used in example optional ribbon to tie around neck pattern pieces head and body arms legs small round ears finished face piece cut and embroidered felt for kitten 1 5 oz ww yarn i like simply soft and an f hook or hook needed to obtain gauge 1 5 oz fuzzy yarn and g hook or hook needed to obtain gauge small piece of white felt embroidery thread or paint for face two eyes 8mm safety eyes used in example optional ribbon to tie around neck pattern pieces head and body arms legs"
