  "notes": "this all over patterned sock design, ebbs and flows from toe to cuff.  the lace increases and the related decreases create this delicate and beautiful effect.\r\n\r\nunfortunately i have only been able to incorporate two sizes within this pattern. you could adjust the size by going up or down a needle size.  the pattern on the sock is very stretchy\r\n\r\nthese socks are worked toe up with a rounded wedge toe and with a heel flap and gusset.  like the toe, the heel flap seamlessly flows into the sock.\r\n\r\nthe instructions for the construction of the socks are written and charted.  the charts have written instructions.\r\n\r\na low vision accessible version of this pattern are also available for size small only. this version includes 24 point arial all black text, no italics, no columns or tables and fully written instructions. there are charts included but the charts are not needed to complete the pattern.\r\n\r\na big thank you to eternalknitter who pre-tested the pattern and provided great feedback and confirmation that the instructions made sense. \r\n \r\nsincere thanks to those who then tested the pattern condichick, baileythegreen, elchkitty, snoopy678, keerthi3031, iriknit1,  yalta and rannapiiga1.\r\n\r\na huge thanks also to condichick, yarnymama and yalta for their ongoing valued advice, guidance, feedback and encouragement.\r\n"
