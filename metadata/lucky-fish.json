  "notes": "materials\r\n- 1 skein of purl soho’s [pepper][1], 100% superwash merino wool. each skein of this sport- to light worsted/dk-weight yarn is 218 yards/ 100 grams; approximately 145 total yards required. we used the colors black cherry, candy apple, eastern bluebird, ferris wheel, and pink apricot.\r\n- us 4 (3.5 mm), 32-inch [circular knitting needles][2] for [magic loop][3] (see notes)\r\n- us 6 (4 mm), 32-inch circular needles for magic loop\r\n- a spare [double pointed needle][4], us 6 or smaller\r\n- [removable stitch markers][5], including 3 unique\r\n- [poly-fil stuffing][6]\r\n\r\ngauge\r\n\r\n40 stitches and 32 rows = 4 inches in 1×1 rib, on smaller needles\r\n\r\n32 stitches and 60 rounds = 4 inches in textured slip stitch pattern (see notes), on larger needles\r\n\r\nsize\r\n- finished body circumference: approximately 7¾ inches-8½ inches, stuffed\r\n- finished length: 14 inches\r\n\r\nmagic loop\r\n\r\nbecause this pattern works a stitch pattern over a small circumference and requires picking up stitches along a curved edge, we found it easiest to use 32-inch circular knitting needles and the magic loop technique. however, feel free to use double pointed needles for the whole thing, if you prefer!\r\n\r\nto learn how to use a magic loop, visit our [magic loop tutorial][7]… a simple way to knit small circumferences!\r\n\r\npattern designed and written by purl soho designer, [hiromi glover][8]. see even more of hiromi’s work [on her instagram][9]!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.purlsoho.com/pepper.html\r\n  [2]: https://www.purlsoho.com/tools-and-notions/collection_filter--circular_needles.html\r\n  [3]: https://www.purlsoho.com/create/magic-loop/\r\n  [4]: https://www.purlsoho.com/tools-and-notions/collection_filter--double_pointed_needles.html\r\n  [5]: https://www.purlsoho.com/tools-and-notions/collection_filter--stitch_markers.html\r\n  [6]: https://www.purlsoho.com/tools-and-notions/collection_filter--stuffing.html\r\n  [7]: https://www.purlsoho.com/create/magic-loop/\r\n  [8]: https://www.purlsoho.com/create/tag/hiromi-glover-for-purl-soho/\r\n  [9]: https://www.instagram.com/mignonnegrise/"
