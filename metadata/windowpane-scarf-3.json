  "notes": "download for free on lovecrafts.\r\n\r\nthe windowpane is the perfect spring or fall scarf to keep the chill off your neck without being bulky. i really enjoy making this scarf, and i have to say i love the finished result each time. the windowpane was designed to showcase the colorshifts in gradient yarns like knit picks chroma fingering, or noro taiyo sock, but you'll also get a beautiful scarf using solid, semi-solid, or variegated yarns. \r\n\r\nfinished (but unblocked) dimensions: 67\" long x 5-1/4\" wide.  \r\n\r\nthis stitch pattern develops a slant toward one side, so a light blocking is definitely recommended. \r\n\r\nthanks to all the crocheters who have posted such great photos of their work - everyone's finished scarves are so beautiful, and i'm loving all the yarn selections! \r\n\r\n"
