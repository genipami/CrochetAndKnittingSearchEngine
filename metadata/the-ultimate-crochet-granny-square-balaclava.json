  "notes": "i call this the “ultimate balaclava” because it is sooo very customizable! though i will be showing you how to make a very basic version of a granny square, you can use any granny square you would like for your balaclava! (i have a [playlist on my youtube][1] were i compiled lots of squares and appliqués from other amazing creators you can follow to customize your balaclava if you want to spice it up a bit!)\r\n\r\n**materials**\r\n\r\nweight 4 yarn – you will need approximately 135grams of yarn. (really any will do! i used up lots of scrap yarn for many of the balaclavas i made.)\r\n\r\n5.00mm hook and 4.00mm hook (4.0mm is optional)\r\n\r\nscissors -\r\n\r\nstitch markers – i don’t personally use these in this pattern, but if you have a hard time knowing where you started, you can use them\r\n\r\ndarning needle\r\n\r\n**stitches + abbreviations**\r\n\r\nch = chain\r\n\r\nst(s) = stitch(es)\r\n\r\nsl st = slip stitch\r\n\r\nsc = single crochet\r\n\r\ndc = double crochet\r\n\r\nmr = magic ring\r\n\r\nblo – back loop only\r\n\r\n**gauge**\r\n\r\nall the squares i made ended up measuring out from 5″-5 1/2″ inches. as i was experimenting with the sizes of squares, i came to notice that the 5″ inch square balaclavas fit me perfectly (my head measures 22″ inches) and the 5 1/2″ inch square balaclavas were a bit big on me, but were still fine!\r\n\r\nso, i’d say…\r\n\r\nfor children: 3 1/2″-4″ inch squares\r\n\r\nfor adult: 5″-5 1/2″ inch squares\r\n\r\nfor adults with larger heads: 5 1/2″-6″ inch squares\r\n\r\n**pattern notes**\r\n\r\n*this pattern uses us crochet terms.\r\n\r\n*turning ch 3 does count as a dc stitch in this pattern\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plmai6slw2hcb6o3g7orafm5evaewn0lyp"
