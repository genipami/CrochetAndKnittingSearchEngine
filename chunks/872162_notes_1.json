    "content": "this scarf is worked up using a basic v_stitch with a single row repeat you may use any hook size you d like however for this pattern i suggest using a 7 00mm or 8 00mm hook as it creates a super soft finished piece that has a really nice drape to it you may also use any worsted weight yarn you like i chose caron cakes simply because i love the colour block look for infinity scarfs please note this listing is for pattern only the finished piece pictured is not available for purchase"
