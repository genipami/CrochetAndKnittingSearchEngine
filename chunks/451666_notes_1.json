    "content": "* pattern last edited and updated on july 05 2014 many thanks to barbara and elizabeth for pointing out the errors * this scarf combines lace and texture in a simple grid-like pattern you just replace the center stitch in every little box of the grid with a yarn over it s a six-row repeat worked over a multiple of 4 stitches plus 1 not including border stitches you will need 350-400 yards or about a hundred grams of fingering weight yarn to get a light scarf you can cast on more stitches if you want a wider scarf or stole in which case you will need more yarn another possibility is to omit the garter row at the beginning and end and seam the ends together to make a cowl"
