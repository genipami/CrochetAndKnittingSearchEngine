  "notes": "this versatile hat pattern includes instructions for two lengths: one reaching the base of the ear and one mid-ear, perfect for adapting to different seasons. living in ontario, i prefer full ear coverage for winter, but a mid-ear length for warmer weather. i thought you'd appreciate the flexibility too!\r\n\r\nthe pattern is worked in continuous rounds (no slip stitch joins or chains), resulting in a seamless, neat finish. however, you can opt to use slip stitches and chain-1 joins if you prefer, just keep the slip stitches small to minimize the seam.\r\n\r\nfor cotton yarn like bernat handicrafter cotton, check out my [basic half double crochet hat pattern for medium weight cotton.][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n♥ rhondda\r\ninstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oombawkadesigncrochet/\r\ninstagram reels: https://www.instagram.com/oombawkadesigncrochet/reels/\r\ntiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@oombawkadesigncrochet\r\npinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/oombawkadesigncrochet/\r\nyoutube: https://www.youtube.com/oombawkadesigncrochet\r\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/oombawkadesigncrochet/\r\nthreads: https://www.threads.net/@oombawkadesigncrochet\r\nnewsletter: https://oombawkadesigncrochet.com/crochet-newsletter\r\n\r\n\r\n© 2012-2024, designed by rhondda mol (oombawka design crochet). all rights reserved. you may sell finished items you crochet from this pattern. no part of this publication may be reproduced, altered, or distributed in any form, or by any means, without express written permission from rhondda mol.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://oombawkadesigncrochet.com/free-half-double-crochet-beanie-hat/"
