  "notes": "the wanderlust beanie is designed for those wild at heart individuals who feel called to explore, to travel, and to blaze new trails. i designed this hat with lion brand \"heartland\" yarn making it soft and cozy, yet lightweight enough for summer evenings. not only would this beanie serve you well on a camping or hiking trip, it would also make an excellent piece to donate to charitable organizations that provide hats for cancer patients.\r\n\r\n[matching mitten pattern is available here][1].\r\n[matching scarf pattern is available here][2].\r\n\r\n*this pattern is available for free on my website, (visit pattern website link below), or you can download it here on ravelry as a printable, ad-free pdf*\r\n\r\n[additional sizing for toddlers and kids is now available over here][3]. \r\n\r\nthe stitch pattern in this beanie is fairly simple, making it an excellent crochet pattern for those who have mastered the basics (single, half-double, and double crochet), and want to play around with them in new ways. while i originally designed this as a men's beanie, the pattern is just as usable for women. you will probably want to go down a hook size, since this hat, as written, will fit a 25\" head (so long as you meet gauge).\r\n\r\nhere's what you'll need to create your own wanderlust experience:\r\n**difficulty:** \r\neasy\r\n\r\n**materials needed:**\r\n5.5mm (i) hook, or hook needed to obtain gauge\r\n225 yards of lion brand heartland yarn in \"joshua tree\"\r\nscissors\r\nyarn needle\r\noptional: leather or fabric tag of your choosing. all this wood has some excellent options, and can do custom orders.\r\n\r\n**stitches used:**\r\nch = chain\r\nsl st = slip stitch\r\nsc = single crochet\r\nhdc = half double crochet\r\ndc = double crochet\r\nfpdc = front post double crochet\r\nbpdc = back post double crochet\r\nst/sts = stitch/stitches\r\n\r\n**additional terms:**\r\nworking in the 3rd loop of hdc. look at the top of the stitch, and locate the sideways “v”, bend the stitch to look at the back, and you should see another “v”. you’ll be working into the back loop of that “v”, this is called the 3rd loop.\r\n\r\n**gauge:**\r\n14 hdc stitches in 4\"\r\n\r\n**measurements:**\r\n10\" wide x 9\" tall\r\n\r\n**additional notes:**\r\n-ch 1 at beginning of round does not count as a stitch.\r\n-final st of round will be worked in the join when increasing.\r\n-while i originally designed this as a men's beanie, the pattern is just as usable for women. you will probably want to go down a hook size, since this hat, as written, will fit a 25\" head (so long as you meet gauge).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/wanderlust-mittens\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/wanderlust-scarf-2\r\n  [3]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/wanderlust-beanie---toddler-and-child-sizes"
