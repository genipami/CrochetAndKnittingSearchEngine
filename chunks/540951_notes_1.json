    "content": "the boyfriend set is the perfect hat and scarf combo for colder days since mistake rib stitch results in a dense rugged texture this pattern will look just a good on the man in your life as it does on you the extra long scarf is thick and cosy and the hat has a folded over edge for extra warmth you could also leave the hat unfolded which results in a slouchy beanie"
