    "content": "found the stitch pattern in a much larger gauge in a sweater pattern on what i think was a blog in portuguese and found it so intriguing i though i d just use it in a scarf pattern a lot of people have asked about how many stitches to cast on for this scarf it really depends upon how wide you want the scarf and the yarn you are using i cast on 56 stitches on mine it will always be a multiple of 10 for the pattern repeat plus an even number of additional stitches for the garter stitch edge i chose six 3 on each edge but you may like four or five instead i hope this helps you to decide"
