  "notes": "do you want to show off that special yarn but are just too bored of knitting a simple vanilla sock?  well, you can let that yarn shine by choosing this sock pattern which will keep you engaged with your knitting whilst producing a very pretty sock that shows off your hand dyed yarn.  this sock also looks very pretty is solid colours :)\r\n\r\nplease note:  the left and right socks have the lace panel placed on opposite sides so that the lace runs down the outer edge of each foot. make sure you read the pattern to achieve this look.",
