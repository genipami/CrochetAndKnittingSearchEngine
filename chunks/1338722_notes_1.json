    "content": "a friend inspired me to come up with a sneaker pattern that features a gentle ballerina style where the cuff sits slightly deeper at the front it took me a while to figure out all the little details but here you go special features - doubled cuff and increases above back heel for a snug fit - my newly unvented lotus heel flap where you work increases at the sides so you do not have to pick up stitches later - short row heel turn - a ballerina neckline worked in row techniques used - provisional cast-on - lifted increases - shadow wrap short row - grafting/kitchener stitch the pattern is written needle neutral so all needle styles can be used dpns one or two circular needles flexi flips etc please be aware that some stitches are shifted from instep to sole update 11 06 2023 now the pattern also features 68 and 72 stitches <hr> because this pattern is also great for charity it is available for free if you would like to thank me consider purchasing one of my other designs for yourself or for a friend or buy me a ko-fi 1 1 https //ko-fi com/stefaniebold"
