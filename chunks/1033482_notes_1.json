    "content": "these sweet little wristers started life as a pair of scrappy socks as i was knitting them i was enjoying working the relaxing rounds so much that i just carried on in no time at all i had a cute pair of wrist warmers i wear these almost every day when i go for my morning walk and they are just perfect they are lightweight and yet keep your hands and wrists lovely and toasty you only need a small amount of yarn so they make the perfect project for your leftovers they knit up in a flash so are great for gift knits the pattern comes in one size that will fit an average female hand 7 to 8 inches in circumference and have a nice bit of ease you can easily adjust the pattern for a different stitch count if necessary my samples were knit from a mini skein set from pixie yarns in gingerbread tango and then various leftovers for the second pair you will need approximately 40g of fingering weight to knit a pair i hope you enjoy this free pattern"
