  "notes": "mug cozies - because it's fall ya'll!\r\n\r\nthese mug cozies were designed for a standard mug size. they are easily adjustable for larger mugs - just continue to work in pattern until the cozy when placed around the mug is approx. 1.5\" from the handle.\r\n\r\nthe cozy is secured around the handle with 2 loops on each end. \r\n\r\nhave fun with color! make them solid or change colors whenever you like. i used multiple colors for some of these as i was using very small bits of scrap yarn and when i would run out i would pick another color.\r\n\r\ni absolutely love these in a patterned or variegated yarn, such as knitcol from adriafil.\r\n\r\nthe pattern contains 3 different style mug cozies. \r\n\r\nhave fun!",
