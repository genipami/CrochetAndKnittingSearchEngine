  "notes": "it's time to stay home and get cozy!  or it's time to welcome family and friends into our homes.  no matter what the activity, i always need to have an intuitive but engaging sock on my needles to keep me happy and calm.  this 6 round repeat ... and only 2 are patterned ... give me enough plain knitting to enjoy the beautiful yarn and a little something to keep me going.\r\n\r\nthis pattern will always be free and is a gift from me to you to thank you for your love and support in 2022!!  i have donated over $2500 to various charities in 2022 with proceeds from sock patterns that you have purchased from me and i can't thank you enough for that love and friendship!\r\n\r\nthank you to stephanie from the creative knitter for the yarn support!\r\n\r\nthe pattern looks great on lots of different types of yarn…give it a try! check out my tester’s project pages for inspiration.\r\n\r\nthe sock is knit from the top down with a garter edge heel flap and traditional gusset. i finished it with my version of a rounded toe.\r\n\r\nsmall 56 stitch, (medium 64 stitch, large 72 stitch).\r\n7 (8, 9) inches / 18 (20.25, 23) cm,approximate foot circumference.\r\n\r\nthere is a simple round with a little cable that can be done with a cable needle or check out the video tutorial in the pattern to see how i do it without a cable needle.\r\n\r\n1 skein of fingering weight yarn and a 20g mini for contrast.\r\n\r\nhuge thanks to my test knitters leanne, heather, jenn, vivian, stephany, nawaal and mara for their feedback and their beautiful socks.",
