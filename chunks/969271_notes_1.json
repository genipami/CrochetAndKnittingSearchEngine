    "content": "here s an easy top you can create in no time a perfect project for spring or the end of summer it s light on yarn usage too because every second round is filet stitch the boatneck raglan jumper is worked seamlessly in one piece from the top down to begin the yoke is worked down to the armholes making 4 sets of raglan increases to form the diagonal lines which run from the neck edge to the underarms the sleeve stitches are then ignored for a while and just the body section worked in joined rounds down to the hem the sleeves are then worked top down by joining at each underarm and working from those previously ignored stitches down to the desired length this garment is generously sized to include about 10cm / 4 of positive ease as all sizes start the same you can try it on and adjust for size as you go thanks loads to my lovely testers apple muz sandra julie and valda i hope you enjoy making this easy raglan sweater message me if you want any help cheers susan"
