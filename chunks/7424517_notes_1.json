    "content": "this cute little chrysanthemum is very easy to make the sample in the photo below was made out of one hank of embroidery floss using a size e 3 5 mm hook the leaves are a little fidgety but only take a few yards to make the pattern includes two versions of the leaf pattern--one that uses foundation stitches and one that doesn t--but either works up in just a few minutes instructions on how to do foundation stitches are included the flower itself is about an inch in diameter of course you can make a larger flower by using thicker yarn and a larger hook without the leaves the flower can also be a fun alternative to a pom-pom"
