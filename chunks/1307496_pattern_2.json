    "content": "is crocheted holding lots of strands of yarn together to make sure the bucket is sturdy i put the bundle of yarns through a needle gauge and use a hook to match so if my yarn bundle goes through the 8mm hole on my needle gauge i use an 8mm hook between 6mm and 9mm gives a nice firm fabric so the bucket stands up the recipe works for smaller sizes too but i ve found anything beyond 9mm too difficult to work with figure 1 my yarn bundle matches my hook size adding new yarn you re using scraps so different strands of your yarn bundle will run out at different times i simply knot a new strand of yarn to the end of the old one and keep going to be honest i don t even weave in my ends and instead just make sure they are on the inside of the bucket varying the size of the bucket as well as changing the size of your yarn bundle and hook or the number of rounds you work for the base of the bucket you can also change the number of stitches you work into the magic loop i ve used a 4mm hook and made a mini fuck-it bucket using only 5 single_crochet in the magic loop that sits next to my sewing machine as a bin for tiny fabric scraps and a really giant one with 8 single_crochet in the magic loop if you prefer something floppier you can easily turn the fuck-it bucket into a bag by crocheting the walls with a half- double_crochet stitch instead of a single_crochet half-treble in the uk how much stash can you bust my average fuck-it bucket comes in at around a kilo 2 2 pounds for americans so it makes a sizeable dent in the scrap stash and they only take a few hours each to stitch you might also like i wrote this up because a lot of people asked me to but there s another version of the recipe from my poppet that s almost exactly the same and pre-dates this written version https //mypoppet com au/makes/crochet-basket-scrap-yarn-projects/"
