    "content": "to figure this one out 4 obviously we re stuck again how do you make a double_crochet when there is nothing to make the double_crochet in to this is a classic case of trying to put the cart before the horse a lot of you right now are going to chime in by saying that kristen ohmdal has thought of a way to solve our problem and if you re really interested in knowing how she does it then by all means read her seamless crochet book i have also seen the very same workaround in a number of japanese pattern books to summarize the idea is to work some extra chains 3 in our case then make the 4 chain ring and then slip_stitch back up those first 3 chains this is getting closer to what we are after but although this is a very clever way of jumping from one motif to the next i don t like this method for at least a couple of reasons one reason is that the 3-chain/slip_stitch section is way bulkier than the double_crochet it is meant to be replacing so it sticks out like a sore thumb as it sits next to its neighboring stitches another reason i don t like this method is that i really find it very fiddly to do slip stitches into a foundation of chain stitches therefore in my opinion this puts us back at square one but hang on to your hooks there is a way of doing this 5 a new stitch you are about to learn a game-changing technique that creates a stand-alone self-sufficient unit that is worked in thin air that not only provides the much-needed center ring of our motif but the first double_crochet as well yep this is worth saying again i am about to show you how to break away from one motif to another by making the center ring and the first double_crochet of the round all in one hit without the need for any previous supporting stitches take a deep breath and understand that once you get the hang of things all this will seem more like you re just working a really fancy stitch here s what this new fancy stitch looks like and yes i can t help saying it again it was worked in mid-air our floating fancy stitch deserves to have a name so from now on it will be called a floating double_crochet fdc again since this stitch is multi-tasking you can see which section is the center ring and which section is the double_crochet so\u2026how do you make one of these 6 floating ring lesson the best way to teach you how to make a floating double_crochet is to explain how to do each section as a separate little lesson therefore we will start by isolating the technique involved in making the center ring section or floating ring as it will be referred to from now on it is important to"
