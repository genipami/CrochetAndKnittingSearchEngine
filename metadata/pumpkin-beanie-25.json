  "notes": "our local knitting guild, the needlework guild of canada, very graciously invited me to attend their first knit in the park, so i whipped up a little kit for them, a pumpkin beanie. we figured it's timely, what with harvest season approaching. plus, there is no child ever who isn't adorable in a pumpkin hat. since our guild knits for charity we wanted it to be something that was gender-neutral, and makes a great gift for anyone. we sized the hat from preemie to kids of all ages, and you should be able to get 2 pumpkin hats out of one kit (and probably a third green hat too). the yarn is the ever soft and berroco vintage, but if you want to upgrade go for the combo we assembled with malabrigo rios.\r\n\r\n\r\n**skill level:** advanced beginner\r\n\r\nthe skill level to be accessible to knitters in the beginner spectrum, so there isn't any colourwork or charts, you just need the following skills:\r\n\r\nread a knitting pattern\r\ncast on & bind off\r\nknit & purl in the same row\r\nwork in the round on circular & double pointed needles\r\nweave in ends\r\nsee our curated list of knitting skills for tutorials\r\n\r\n\r\n**size**\r\n- preemie (0-6 mos, 6-18mos, 18mos-4yrs, 4yrs-adult s)\r\n- to fit head circumference: 14.5(16.75, 18, 20.5, 21.5)” or 36(42, 45, 51, 54) cm\r\n- note: fabric is stretchy. if you want a tighter fit go down a needle size\r\n- photo is size 0-6mos: after blocking measures 7.75\" wide\r\n\r\n**gauge**\r\n20 sts & 26 rounds = 4”/10cm with 4.5mm/us7 circular needles after blocking\r\n \r\n\r\n**materials**\r\n- berroco vintage (or malabrigo rios): 1 skein in each of 2 colours. - our sample is made with vintage (mc) 5176 pumpkin & (cc) 51174 spruce.\r\n- pattern \r\n- 4.5mm/us7-16” circular needles\r\n- 3.75mm/us5-16” circular needles (for brim)\r\n- 4.5mm/us7 double pointed needles\r\n- stitch markers\r\n- darning needle"
