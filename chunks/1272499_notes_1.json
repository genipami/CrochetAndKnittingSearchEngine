    "content": "originally from weldon s practical needlework volume 1 practical knitter published c 1885 this is my adapted version of this pattern these gloves are knit flat seamed and then embroidered both gloves are knit the exact same you make a left and right version by folding one glove one way and seaming and the other glove the opposite way and seaming this pattern seems easily customizable by adjusting stitch counts row increases or you could try sizing up your yarn weight and/or needles a video tutorial for this pattern can be found here https //youtu be/_qqnbpjnnli"
