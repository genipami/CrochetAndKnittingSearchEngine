  "notes": "the haze sweater is my festive free release for 2022. inspired by traditional nordic knitting, it is a sweater with a circular yoke that is worked both top down and in the round. the yoke is decorated with two-stranded colourwork that is both fun and easy to knit. first, a double-folded collar is worked. you will then work the yoke, all of which is charted and shaped with simple yarn-over increases, before starting some german short rows to give the sweater a bit of extra structure. you then divide the sleeve and body sections of the yoke, cast on some underarm stitches, and proceed to work the body. you will then work the sleeves.\r\n\r\nthank you so much for your support of tkpg over the past year; i'm so grateful and am pleased to be able to share this pattern with you as thanks for everything.\r\n\r\n**sophie xxx**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**materials & fit**\r\n \r\n**notions:** 3.5 mm / us 4 (40-, 80 and 100-cm / 16-, 32- and 40-in cord) and 4.5 mm / us 7 (40-, 60-, 80-, and 100-cm / 16-, 32- and/or 40-in cord) circular needles. you may also find some 3.5 / us 4 and 4.5 mm / us 7 double-pointed knitting needles useful for the sleeves.\r\n\r\nyou will also need a few stitch markers, a darning needle, and some spare needles/scrap yarn/stitch holders where the stitches of the sleeves will rest. they are not necessary, but you might also find some clip-on markers useful to help you keep track of your progress and for working the cast-off. \r\n\r\n**yarn:** approximately 7 (7-8) 8 (8) 9, (9-10) 10 (10) 10-11 (11) 12 skeins in your main colour and approximately 1 (1) 1 (1) 1-2, (1-2) 1-2 (1-2) 1-2 (1-2) 2 skeins in your contrast colour of lopi léttlopi (100% icelandic wool; 50 g = 100 m/109 yrds). for the sample garment, i used the shades white (#0051) for my main colour and milky way (#1702) for my contrast colour. \r\n\r\nif you want to substitute these yarns for alternatives, this works out to be approximately 700 (700-800) 800 (800) 900, (900-1,000) 1,000 (1,000) 1,000-1,110 (1,100) 1,200 m / 763 (763-872) 872 (872) 981, (981-1,090) 1,090 (1,090) 1,090-1,199 (1,1,99) 1,308 yrds in your main colour and approximately 100 (100) 100 (100) 100-200, (100-200) 100-200 (100-200) 100-200 (100-200) 200 m / 109 (109) 109 (109) 109-218, (109-218) 109-218 (109-218) 109-218 (109-218) 218 yrds in your contrast colour.\r\n\r\n**please note that this pattern has not been tested and so the yardages given here are approximations based on the number of stitches in the pattern and the sample garment. the fit of the sweater is relatively cropped, so if you know you prefer longer garments, add an extra skein or two on to the quantities given here. if in doubt, i highly recommend ordering more yarn than is recommended here to avoid issues with dye lots and a scary game of yarn chicken.**\r\n\r\n**i will update the recommended yardage in the pattern when more people have knitted it to give the most accurate information possible. for the sample garment, i used just over half a skein over my contrast colour in the size d and just under 7.5 skeins of my main colour, keeping in mind again that i prefer a cropped fit .** \r\n\r\n**tension:** 20 sts x 24 rounds in stocking stitch on 4.5 mm / us 7 needles. make sure to wash and block your swatch for the most accurate results. please note, though, that i have unusually tight row gauge. you may wish to go up or down a needle size, working in 0.25/0.5 mm / us 0.5 increments as needed, to meet gauge.\r\n \r\n**sizing and ease:** the haze sweater has a recommended positive ease of between 5-10 cm / 2-4 in for sizes a-h, and 5-15 cm / 2-6 in for sizes i-k. if you would prefer more or less ease, however, feel free to change size to achieve your desired fit. use the schematic below to find your size. \r\n\r\n**size:** a (b) c (d) e, (f) g (h) i (j) k\r\n\r\n**chest measurement (cm):** 75-80 (80-85) 85-90 (90-95) 95-100, (100-105) 105- 110 (110-115) 115-125 (125-135) 135-145\r\n**chest measurement (in):** 29.5-31.5 (31.5-33.5) 33.5-35.5 (35.5-37.5) 37.5-39.25, (39.25-41.25) 41.25-43.25 (43.25-45.25) 45.25-49.25 (49.25-53.25) 53.25-57\r\n\r\n**actual circumference of garment (cm):** 85 (90) 95 (100) 105, (110) 115 (120) 130 (140) 150\r\n**actual circumference of garment (in):** 33.5 (35.5) 37.5 (39.5) 41.5, (43.25) 45.25 (47.25) 51.25 (55.25) 59\r\n\r\n**actual yoke depth (cm):** (20.5) 21 (21.5) 23, (25) 25 (26.5) 28.5 (31) 33 \r\n**actual yoke depth (in):** 7.75 (8) 8.25 (8.5) 9, (9.75) 9.75 (10.5) 11.25 (12.25) 13 \r\n\r\n**sleeve circumference at upper bicep (cm):** 29 (32) 32 (33) 34, (36) 35.5 (36.5) 39.5 (46) 47\r\n**sleeve circumference at upper bicep (in):** 11.5 (12.5) 12.5 (13) 13.25, (14.25) 14 (14.25) 15.5 (18) 18.5\r\n\r\n**recommended sleeve length (cm):** 45, with options to modify included in the pattern\r\n**recommended sleeve length (in):** 17.75, with options to modify included in the pattern\r\n\r\n**recommended length from bottom of collar to hem (cm):** 47 (49) 50 (51) 53, (55) 57 (59) 60 (61) 63 cm \r\n**recommended length from bottom of collar to hem (in):** 18.5 (19.25) 19.5 (20) 20.75, (21.5) 22.5 (23.25) 23.5 (24) 24.75\r\n\r\n*please note that all measurements given in inches are rounded to the nearest quarter inch.*",
