    "content": "this no-sew octo pattern is an edited adaptation to my previous no-sew small octopus pattern it is designed with scrap yarn in mind never throw away your scraps stripe them and use them in this itty bitty octopus aside from closing if you use safety eyes there is no sewing at all for this project and it works up in about 30-35 minutes these will make great quick grabs at markets or make them even smaller with a b hook and dk cotton yarn for a key chain the instructions for that are also included in the design great for beginners to amigurumi so simple"
