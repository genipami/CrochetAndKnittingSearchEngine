  "notes": "get creative while knitting the dice bag of minimal magic to come up with minimal magical bonuses for you and your dungeons and dragons party.\r\n\r\nthis bag is knit from the top down and in the round. the instructions in the pattern can be easily modified to create what you want, and that’s on purpose! have fun, play around, even pull it and start over if you don’t like it. but always remember to work some minimal magic into your bag as you go!\r\n\r\nthis is the first pattern that i've published, so the pattern has a bit of a “go with the flow” vibe to it and isn’t meant to be super precise. perhaps…. *that’s where the magic comes from!?*\r\n\r\nhere is a great video tutorial of the brioche stitch i used in the pattern:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj0kltvchv0\r\n\r\n**examples of minimal magic**\r\n\r\nthe dice bag of second breakfast (halfling) – once a session, at any point during combat, stop to eat second breakfast and restore 1d4 of health. \r\n\r\nthe dice bag of miracle max (dungeon master) – once a session, at any point during combat, miracle max runs into the room and revives a dead enemy. the enemy rolls 1d4 damage before dying again. \r\n",
