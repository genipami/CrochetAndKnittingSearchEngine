    "content": "the nudo headband a knitting pattern by january + july materials gauge 5 stitches per inch size us 6 straight needles or size to obtain gauge i used circulars to knit flat sport or light worsted weight yarn or weight to obtain gauge i used a vanna s choice denim sport weight note gauge is not strictly enforced what really matters is that your finished headband is the length and width you want which is best achieved by measuring as you go pattern the basic concept of this headband is to knit a very long swatch in stockinette stitch tie a knot in it and seam the ends together that s it cast on 40 stitches i also do 35 sometimes this will seem like too many but you want it to be scrunchy after the knot is tied should be about eight to nine inches wide i used long tail cast on because i am lazy but ideally you d do a provisional cast on so that you can seam it invisibly at the end don t worry i have constructed this to still be invisible cast on as you please *slip one purlwise purl to end of row turn slip one knitwise knit to end of row turn * continue knitting in stockinette with slipped stitch edges until your rectangle swatch measures approximately 30 inches the way i measure/construct is to knit it about 6-8 inches tie a knot in the fabric and then continue knitting to fit my head adult head is 21-23 inches this is why i say approximately 30 inches the measurements depend on your head as well as how tightly you tie the knot try it on often bind off if you cast on provisionally do not bind off use kitchener stitch to seam your live cast- on edge to your current live stitches otherwise bind off in your favorite method make sure you have a standard overhand knot tied in your swatch before you seam the ends together once your knot is tied and your end bound off sew the ends together i used a basic mattress stitch next weave in your ends the last step is to adjust the knot you ve tied so that it covers up your seam to do this loosely undo the knot which is technically impossible to completely untie now that your ends are connected into a loop and tighten it back up while wiggling it to make sure the seam stays covered it takes some finesse and a few tries but it will look awesome with some adjusting that s it you did it 1 2 3 1 finished product 2 slipped stitch edge 3 the seam inside the knot"
