  "notes": "**this is a pay what you want pattern! use the code seasons50 for 50% off the original price or use the code seasons100 for a free copy. if you download for free, i’d love it if you gave this pattern a ❤️. thank you for your support!\r\n\r\nthe *changing seasons coaster* is a quick, beginner-friendly project that’s as fun to make as it is to use. designed with simplicity in mind, it works up fast—perfect for a last-minute gift, a relaxing evening project, or a satisfying stash-buster. what makes this coaster special is its decorative flair: a playful design at the center finished with an extravagant, eye-catching border that instantly elevates the look. cute, practical, and endlessly customizable with color choices, this little piece is the perfect way to add handmade charm to your table through every season.\r\n\r\nthis pattern is worked with dk/worsted weight yarn and a 4.5 mm hook. for coasters, i recommend using a synthetic or plant-based fiber—these tend to be more durable and easier to wash, making them perfect for everyday use. the design is worked in the round with simple double crochet and chain stitches, creating an easy, enjoyable rhythm as you go. it’s finished with a decorative lace border that combines shell and picot variations for an extra touch of charm.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is written in one standard size, which fits most mugs comfortably. if you’d like a larger or smaller coaster, you can easily adjust by changing your hook size, experimenting with different yarn weights, or adding a round or two.\r\n\r\nthis is a beginner-friendly project that relies on simple stitches and approachable techniques. to support you along the way, you’ll also find a step-by-step photo tutorial at the end of the pattern, plus links to video demonstrations for all special stitches.\r\n\r\nthank you for choosing my pattern, i hope you enjoyed it. if you enjoyed this pattern, you may be interested in some of my other patterns–you can check them out [here][1] :) you may sell as many of the finished items as you wish, but if you share on social media please give me credit @elly donner on ravelry and link the pattern to its source. if you have any questions or need pattern support, please contact me [here][2] @stopitharry on ravelry. i appreciate your support!\r\n\r\nthank you to my amazing testers [divavonpurl](/people/divavonpurl), [jstockert](/people/jstockert), [kaikelasa](/people/kaikelasa), [jooleej](/people/jooleej), [bellaseesstars](/people/bellaseesstars), [kerrydemps](/people/kerrydemps), [yarnseed](/people/yarnseed), [coffeebuddy](/people/coffeebuddy), [katisha](/people/katisha), [batty4yarn](/people/batty4yarn), [minnepurle](/people/minnepurle), [ciscavm](/people/ciscavm), [esme9812](/people/esme9812), [sharonluvs2knit2](/people/sharonluvs2knit2), [beckymerr](/people/beckymerr), [maylina](/people/maylina), & [czerwonykapturek](/people/czerwonykapturek)! this pattern wouldn't have been possible without your help :)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/designers/elly-donner\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/people/stopitharry"
