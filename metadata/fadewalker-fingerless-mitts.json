  "notes": "the fadewalker mitts are inspired by the stitch pattern for the jaywalker socks by grumperina.  the pattern comes in two sizes and was designed for a 5-skein mini set, but you can also fade 5 colors of your choice or use a single tonal, multi or self-striping yarn for a different look. \r\n\r\nround-by-round instructions are provided in table form to make it easier to see how the instructions for the fade, stitch pattern, and thumb gusset line up.  pattern instructions are written for dpns, but can be adjusted for the use of 9\" circular needles or the magic loop method.\r\n\r\n**yardage requirements:**\r\n\r\nfingering-weight yarn in 5 different colors for fade mitt:\r\n\r\n* s – 45 yards of color 4 and 35 yards of the other colors \r\n* m – 55 yards of color 4 and 45 yards of the other colors\r\n\r\nfingering-weight yarn in tonal, multi or striping yarn for one-color mitt: \r\n\r\n* s – 185 yards\r\n* m – 235 yards\r\n\r\npattern has been test-knitted.",
