    "content": "of notes to hopefully make the pattern easier to understand please read through them carefully before you begin -chain-1 or chain-2 at beginning of row does not count as a stitch -chain-3 or chain-4 at beginning of row does count as a stitch/stitch + chain -in order to keep the textured ridges created when working the half_double_crochet in the 3rd loop on the right side of the blanket you will need to cut your yarn and attach to the opposite end with the right side facing -if you are crocheting this blanket in 1 solid color as opposed to the 2 or 3 i recommend you will not have quite as many ends to weave in but you will still be cutting and reattaching your yarn periodically to keep the texture on the right side of the blanket"
