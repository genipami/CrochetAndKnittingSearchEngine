  "notes": "the tea rose spa set is designed to pamper and invigorate the skin, body, mind, and spirit. this collection of reusable, eco-friendly skin care essentials and spa tools includes a crochet face scrubby (make up remover pad), bath pouf, soap saver pouch, and facial washcloth. all designs are quick and easy, and suitable for beginners. there is no sewing or attaching of pieces needed; all items are worked in one piece.\r\n\r\nthe face scrubby includes a special puff stitch worked in the round, and can be crocheted in 15-20 minutes! it can be a great stash buster if you have some extra cotton yarn lying around.   the bath pouf (“loofah”) is very quick to work up as well, taking only about 45 minutes, and uses less than one full skein of the lily sugar n’ cream yarn in this pattern.  the mesh soap saver pouch (or, soap holder bag) has a nifty little drawstring that fits a standard bar of soap, and takes only 30 minutes to crochet.  lastly, the facial washcloth can be whipped up in an hour’s time, and features the beautiful – but oh, so easy – suzette stitch! \r\n\r\nthis gift set is perfect as a mother’s day gift, birthday gift, teacher gift, retirement gift, or even an appreciation “thank you” gift for anyone that could use some pampering and self-care! they’re also great for selling at craft fairs.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n**finished measurements:**\r\nface scrubby: 4” in diameter \r\nbath pouf: 3.5” wide (11” circumference) \r\nsoap saver pouch: 5” wide x 5.5” tall when laid flat \r\nfacial washcloth: 10” x 10”\r\n\r\n**level:** \t\r\nbeginner. requires familiarity with stitches used (below) and attaching yarn.\r\n\r\n**stitches/terms (us terms):** \r\nmr: magic ring\r\nyo: yarn over\r\nsk: skip\r\nst: stitch\r\nch: chain\r\nsl st: slip stitch \r\nsc: single crochet\r\ndc: double crochet\r\ninc: increase (insert two sts in one st)\r\n\r\n**materials:** \r\n\r\n* worsted medium weight (4) 100% cotton yarn.\r\n*note: i used lily sugar n' cream yarn (120 yards/skein) in the following colors: tea rose (2 skeins), camomile (2 skeins), white (1 skein)* \r\n* 6.00 mm hook\r\n* yarn needle\r\n* scissors\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n*this pattern is © 2019 sweet softies. you have permission to sell finished products made from this pattern, but you must credit sweet softies as the owner/creator of this pattern by linking to my website or facebook page. no wholesale. you may not copy, alter, or sell my patterns in part or in whole in any way. my patterns may not be used in teaching online classes. my patterns may be used in teaching in-person classes only with written consent from me. you may link to this pattern but you may not copy any part of the pattern instructions on other websites.*"
