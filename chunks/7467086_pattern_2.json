    "content": "will leave you with a non-stretchy hat you can easily wear as is or you can add earflaps or ribbing as desired for ribbing you d pick up and knit the bottom edge copying the increases you might ve had to include for the top to get the same amount of stitches on top and bottom of band then it s the rib pattern of your choice for earflaps or to knit down to cover the neck you re going to go to the back edge of the hat band where you joined the two ends count the number of stitches you used to knit up the crown and figure out 2/3rds of that number if you had 72 stitches you d divide by 3 to get 24 and then multiply by 2 to get 48 stitches from the back seam using your numbers you d then count 24 stitches in each direction for a total of 48 this starts to give you the panel that will cover the neck leaving 24 cable band edges stitches for above the eyes and putting the cable seam at the back of the head for this panel you can do any knit/purl stitch you want i ve used moss stitch honeycomb cables extra warmth plain old garter but probably not a rib as you don t want it to pull you want it to cover the neck knit back and forth until the neck is covered 1-2 inches then start to do decreases on each side they should mirror each other so as to round off the bottom and give you a place to tie on the braids again optional the only thing that is not optional is the obnoxious pompom bind off weave all edges in create braids and pompom 24 inches is a good length for the braid so i would cut off three 48 inch pieces of the color i wanted also bulky yarn and fold them to braid a basic 3 braid length do two of those attach to the bottom corners of the hat where the decreases are and tie to keep it on your head here s how to make giant pompoms you need a piece of cardboard big enough to cut two large circles of the same size you ll cut a decent sized hole in the middle of both of these maybe 1 \u00bd inches and then decide the outside circumference of your circle based on how large you want the pompom to be the strings of the pom are going to be as long as the measurement between inside and outside circles so if you want a 4 pompom you need that measurement to be 2 both circles should be identical hold the circles together and start wrapping yarn of your choice around both of them it should look like 1 piece wrap and wrap and wrap until you don t see cardboard you can do less if you like a wussy pompom sometimes"
