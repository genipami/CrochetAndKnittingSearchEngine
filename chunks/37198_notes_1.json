    "content": "the tea cozy has enjoyed a healthy relationship with knitting for generations i came up with this one because i was tired of my tea getting cold during long latin study sessions but i didn t want to obscure my teapot s lovely curves i also tend to lose things and i knew that a tea cozy that require full removal would not last long in my house voila a form-fitting sweater for my loved study buddy the ribbing and negative ease holds the fabric snugly against the side of the teapot and a little button flap keeps the whole thing secured the lid remains uncovered for easy tea-making access and the thumb gusset for the spout the key to this mitten-inspired cozy ensures that the tea isn t rudely frozen on the way out due to the fitted nature of this pattern my numbers are not likely to be perfect for all teapots indeed one could make this out of just about any yarn and get a completely different effect rustic yarns like moderately slubby singles and handspun look great on a brown betty many talented knitters have made some really fantastic modifications of this simple pattern -- adding colourwork and cables or altering stitch counts to fit their teapots check out the projects page above **note on row 9** this is the row where the ribbing at the bottom increases to allow for the widening of the teapot and it s also the spot where the split for the handle comes in so with all those moving parts it s an easy spot for confusion to show up here s a more detailed explanation of row 9 that might help if you re having trouble part of the problem about communicating about this on ravelry is that using asterisks here converts the text to italics or bold instead so rather than the asterisks used in the pattern in this note i m going to use curly brackets row 9 rs k2 p1 k1 m1 k1 twelve times m1p pm m1p pm twelve more times p1 k first stitch from next needle turn in the abbreviations it says that when you encounter two asterisks or in this note two curly brackets you repeat the stitch pattern mentioned earlier in the line between the asterisks that means that you re doing this k2 p1 k1 m1 k1 12 times m1p pm p1 k1 m1 k1 m1p pm p1 k1 m1 k1 12 times p1 k first stitch from next needle turn 1 http //afabletoaster wordpress com"
