    "content": "these socks are named after my wonderful boyfriend who gets a lot of the socks i knit since ash is a unisex name it makes sense to name these unisex socks after him or you could see it as a tribute to the volcano causing so much travel disruption at the moment the men s size are knit in a sport weight yarn using 2 75mm needles and the women s are knit using fingering weight yarn 4 ply and 2 5mm needles the pattern is written with double-pointed needles in mind but is easily converted to magic loop or two-circular knitting instructions are for a top-down sock with a heel flap but it should be pretty easy to take the stitch pattern and use it with your favourite sock construction"
