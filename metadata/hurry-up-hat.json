  "notes": "i have added the pattern for this hat to my [7 hats more ebook][1] as a bonus pattern.\r\n\r\nplease note, there was a mistake in the first version of the pattern.  it has been corrected and the pattern has been updated.  the * needs to be in front of the k1 at the beginning.  sorry for the confusion.\r\n\r\nthis is my go-to, in a hurry, need a hat right now, pattern.  usually knit for my son, who loses, or gives away his warm hats with great regularity!  it can be knit with any super bulky weight yarn that knits to about 10 sts in 4 inches or a couple of chunky strands held together works great as well.  knit it plain or knit it striped, it knits fast either way.\r\n\r\ni can knit one of these in about 3 hours.  it is great for binge watching any of your favourite programs.  it is a perfect last minute gift or just right for charity knitting.\r\n\r\nthe crown shaping is a little bit different and gives the hat a nice finish, especially when striped.\r\n\r\n**materials:** drops andes (beige/grey) or drops snow (pink/grey), 100 m in one or two colours, 8.0 mm us #11 circs and dpns, markers and the regular notions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/sources/7-hats-more/patterns",
