  "notes": "hat has a 21″ circumference and is 8” long and comes just to the bottom of the ears. additional rounds can be added by repeating round 6 if you desire a longer hat or want a cuff.\r\n\r\nthe hat pattern makes a great helmet cap and is designed for charity work. i encourage you to use the free pattern for soldiers helmet hats."
