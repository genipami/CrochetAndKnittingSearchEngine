  "notes": "to watch a talk i gave to knitting4peace on the inspiration for my designs and my brand new finger puppets [click here!][1] to just watch my fingerprint puppet section [click here!][2]\r\n\r\nthese cheerful and diversity-friendly finger puppets were designed for [knitting4peace][3]. they are knit in the round, on dpns, with bobble boots and arms to save on fiddly sewing. the girl’s hair is attached by looping it around the head hole with a tapestry needle. for both the adult and child sizes i recommend sock/fingering. for slightly bigger puppets you could use sport or dk.\r\n\r\n**permission**\r\nalthough these puppets were designed for knitting4peace, you have my permission to use them in any way you wish, but i do ask that you make a small donation of $5 dollars (or more) in exchange. you can donate [here!][4] if $5 is not doable please consider this pattern a gift. **these puppets would also be a great gift to a school classroom to remind children that all are welcome!**\r\n\r\n> **praise for fingerprint puppets**\r\n> \r\n> these are so cute and fun to make.\r\n> ([elemenopeo][5])\r\n> \r\n> quick little knit. ([gigiginny][6])\r\n> \r\n> i found the pattern very easy to\r\n> follow, and a super fun knit. i was\r\n> worried that it would be futzy, but\r\n> the clever bobble feet and hands were\r\n> easy to do and ending up very neat\r\n> looking.  ([longmontkathy][7])\r\n> \r\n> they are so cute! thank you, natasha,\r\n> for always designing such cute dolls.\r\n> (mirihi)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://youtu.be/sgvmbaxx7fo?si=2xovoilsahmvpwhs&t=285\r\n  [2]: https://youtu.be/sgvmbaxx7fo?si=luszwp9yg7vstmwj&t=2045\r\n  [3]: https://www.ravelry.com/groups/knitting4peace\r\n  [4]: https://www.knitting4peace.org/donate\r\n  [5]: https://www.ravelry.com/projects/elemenopeo/fingerprint-puppet\r\n  [6]: https://www.ravelry.com/projects/gigiginny/little-puppet\r\n  [7]: https://www.ravelry.com/projects/longmontkathy/finger-puppet",
