  "notes": "this scarf is inspired by red heart’s free pattern for a corner to corner afghan. see bottom of this article for the links and video instructions for that afghan. i am not taking responsibility for designing this pattern. by using red heart’s pattern and the corner to corner concept, you can make unlimited triangles and 4 sided projects. corner to corner doesn’t mean the project needs to be square."
