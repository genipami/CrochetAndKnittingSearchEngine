  "notes": "this project is light and airy, with a circular center and delicate picots on each arm. just like the other designs, it uses almost exclusively basic stitches in fun combinations.\r\n\r\nthis snowflake is a part of the 2025 free crochet snowflake patterns collection. see all snowflake patterns [here on crochetpedia.com][1].\r\n\r\nthe pattern is available in the form of **written instructions** and **video tutorials** for right- and left-handed crocheters.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://crochetpedia.com/crochet-snowflakes-mini-cal/"
