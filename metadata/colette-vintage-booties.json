  "notes": "this pattern is inspired from my favorite stay-on baby booties. the ones my great aunt-in-law colette knitted for my daughter when she was born, and the ones i’ve knitted for every baby in the family since then. the main fabric is in garter stitch for its squishiness, with a high ribbed leg, and a crocheted tie to keep the booties on baby’s feet. they are worked from the bottom up, starting with the sole. it’s also the perfect match to use the remaining yarn of every baby newborn sweater.\r\n\r\nif you prefer to work it seamlessly, it’s doable. there's a recipe at the end of the pattern.\r\n\r\none pattern “on the go” version (pattern on one page only, without pictures) is provided as a separated file.\r\n\r\n**size:**\r\nonesize (newborn - 1 month), sole is 9 cm x 3 cm\r\n\r\n**yarn:**\r\nfingering yarn (400 m / 100 g), approx of 80 m of mc and of 20 m of cc\r\nshown in fonty moustache (50% merino, 30% mohair, 20% silk\r\n225 meters / 50 grams)\r\n\r\n**needles:**\r\n2.5 mm straight needles + 1 short 23 cm or dpns\r\nan additional 2.25 mm or 2 mm straight (or circular) needle to pick up stitches easily for the pleat folding\r\n\r\n**gauge:**\r\n15 sts x 32 rows for 5 cm in garter stitch with 2.5 mm needles\r\n\r\n**notions:**\r\ntapestry needle\r\n4 markers + 1 removable marker if necessary\r\n3 mm crochet hook\r\n\r\n**level:** advanced beginner / intermediate knitter \r\n\r\nthank you to my bunch of testers: christine07 / raphaelle74 / chocolatekate / clairesoleil / valeriecorner & domguyane"
