  "notes": "**pattern or download support?** - please send a private message or personal email, as i can’t respond to comments.\r\n\r\nsevernside beanie, a design that captures the beauty of\r\nthe river severn, flowing near the edge of the forest where i live. this pattern is part of the severnside set, which also includes a pair of mitts. inspired by the ever-changing views of the river, the beanie features a cable motif that mimics the river's winding path. inside the motif, you'll find a delicate seed stitch detail, adding texture and depth, while a column of twisted stitches frames the design, symbolising the steady banks that guide the river. \r\n\r\nworked in the round from the bottom up, beginning with a\r\ndouble-folded ribbed brim for extra warmth. as you progress, you'll find a rhythmic flow of the cables, a process that mirrors the calming influence of the river. wear it on a brisk walk through the forest and it’ll soon become a cherished piece. pair it with the severnside mitts for a coordinated look that brings a piece of the river’s magic into your knitting.\r\n\r\nsizes: 1 (2, 3)\r\n\r\nfinished measurements: \r\nto fit head: 49-52 (53-57, 58-62) cm [19.25-20.5 (20.75-22.5, 22.75-24.5)”], child (adult s-m, adult l)\r\nfinished beanie body circumference: 44 (48, 54) cm [17.25 (19, 21.25)”]\r\n\r\nneedles: 3.5 mm (us 4) double-pointed needles or 80 cm [32”] circular needles for magic loop.  cable needle if not using the ‘no cable needle’ method.\r\n\r\ngauge:  21 sts & 30 rnds = 10 cm [4”] in reverse stockinette stitch\r\n26-st cable = 9 cm [3.5”]\r\n\r\nnotions: sewing needle, stitch markers.\r\n\r\nyarn: annabel williams perendale dk (dk weight, 100% wool, 245m/268 yds per 100g/3.5oz skein) 1, (1, 1) skeins. or approx. 180 (210, 237) m / 197 (230, 260) yds of dk weight yarn. maroon sample in colourway \"woodland\". dark green sample in \"severnside\".\r\n\r\nnote: if adding a pom pom to size 3, leftover yarn from the mitts will be sufficient if working both patterns. if only working the beanie, an additional skein is required.\r\n\r\nvideo link for cables and how to videos can be found in the pattern. \r\n\r\nthis pattern is available for free on sign up. future patterns are shared with subscribers as they are released. if you’d like access to additional patterns from my collection, they are available via a contribution through ko-fi: [https://ko-fi.com/annabelwilliamsyarn][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://ko-fi.com/annabelwilliamsyarn"
