  "notes": "**gingerbread tree & christmas tree ornaments** is an original crochet pattern by june gilbank.\r\n\r\nchunky and flat, just like the edible cookie version, the gingerbread tree ornament is a perfect blank canvas for decorating with beads, embroidery, or whatever crafty ‘icing’ you like. or make the christmas tree version in green or white with a brown trunk. \r\n\r\nboth versions are crocheted amigurumi-style (in a continuous spiral) from only 10 yds of yarn with no sewing, so the pattern works up quickly with minimal finishing!\r\n\r\n**yarn:** small quantity of worsted weight yarn in a gingerbread shade, or green (or white) and brown\r\n\r\n**hook:** us e / 3.5mm\r\n\r\n**size:** approx 3.5\" (9cm) tall. (your gauge and yarn choice will affect the finished size slightly.)\r\n\r\nnote: this pattern is donationware - the pattern is available for free, but if you like it please consider sending me a donation to show your appreciation. the pdf version, available for any size donation, is formatted for easy viewing and printing, and includes bonuses (a 2-page guide to the embroidery and embellishments used on the sample trees, and additional info and left-handed photos). the complete pattern is available to view in full (for no charge) from the linked page.\r\n\r\n***\r\n> ***please join us*** *in the [planetjune crochet designs\r\n> group](http://www.ravelry.com/groups/planetjune-crochet-designs)\r\n> - you can get pattern support, join crochet-alongs, show off your fos,\r\n> suggest new designs, and chat. all\r\n> welcome!*"
