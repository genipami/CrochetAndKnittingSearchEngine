  "notes": "designed to use up your left over fingering weight yarn, this hat can be as colorful or subdued as you like. the hat lays flat without a cuff thanks to the latvian braids. you don't even have to block it! \r\n\r\none size fits most heads because the construction makes a soft and springy hat that stays on. \r\n\r\nyarn needed: knit picks palette or other fingering weight 100% wool yarn.\r\nmain color: 106 yds/23 grams\r\nan assortment of fingering weight wool totaling approximately 153 yds. (4.5 yds each color per braid)\r\npick contrasting colors (1 light and 1 dark) for the latvian braid.\r\n\r\nthis was not tested with superwash yarn. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
