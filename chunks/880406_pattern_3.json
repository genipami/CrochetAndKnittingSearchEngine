    "content": "your toe depth t this calculation works because the heel has almost the same depth as the toe the length of your work to just before the heel = l t = my sock length l = 9 and my t = 2 25 so i worked until the foot measured 9 - 2 25 = 6 75 heel switch to single_crochet single_crochet the heel is worked in row on only half of the sock stitches h = s/2 h = my h = 26 for a standard short-row heel you start with half the stitches h decrease down to half the number of stitches in the toe after r1 f then increase back up to h stitches lay your sock down so that the foundation chain of the toe is flat you should have finished your last foot section round at one side edge but if not esc across till you are at the side shortening row here by leaving the last stitch unworked on each row after r1 you decrease your stitch count and create bumps at the edges which will be smoothed out as you work the second lengthening half of the heel r1 ch1 turn single_crochet in h stitches across working on the wrong side i e from inside your sock h r2 ch1 turn single_crochet in h - 1 stitches i e decreasing 1 at end of row by leaving 1 stitch unworked h-1 repeat r2 until only f stitches remain finishing with a wrong side row f i worked 19 row decreasing from 26 down to 8 first row has no decrease lengthening row you will increase 1 stitch at the end of each row until you have h stitches again the tricky part of short row heels is making the ends of the lengthening row neat and non-gappy you need to smooth out the bumps created on the shortening row and there are a few ways to do it i saw this method in milobo s socks that fit and it s the best i ve seen i m not sure if milobo created it but i m glad she used it there r1 ch1 turn single_crochet in f single_crochet across row single_crochet in side of last stitch slip_stitch into the previous row s unworked stitch this fills in the bumps and starts creating a smooth edge f+1 single_crochet the slip_stitch is not counted r2 no chain turn skip slip_stitch single_crochet across row single_crochet in side of last stitch slip_stitch into unworked stitch just below it f+2 repeat r2 until all of the bumps have disappeared finishing with a wrong side row h for me that was 18 row leg switch to extended single_crochet esc and working in continuous rounds on the right side there will be a small gap on each side between the heel and the instep which you close by adding a couple of extra stitches just choose a couple of loops evenly spaced across the gap and work single_crochet"
