    "content": "this fun-to-knit hood is equally fun to wear keep the cowl tucked into a jacket and the hood can be up or down ready when its needed the modular construction means the whole hood and cowl body is worked together in one piece and then the ribbed front edging is added last with one very short seam to be sewn at the end the sizes are flexible and both adult/teen sizes with the smaller being more fitted or for smaller heads or shorter hair and the larger being a bit roomier play with adjusting gauge to go smaller for a child or try super bulky weight yarn for an oversized hood"
