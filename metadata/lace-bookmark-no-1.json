  "notes": "a beautiful and functional lace bookmark made using 2.00 mm needles and 2 skeins of embroidery thread (or lace/light fingering yarn). \r\n\r\ni designed this pattern using the instructions for [curvy eyelet lace by brome fields][1], with a small garter stitch border and a pointed end, perfect for hanging a beaded tassel. the whole thing knits up in about 2 hours, making an excellent last-minute gift. \r\n\r\nfor help with the tassel, i would recommend any youtube tutorial!\r\n\r\nedit 22/01/2025: i've updated the pdf with some spelling corrections and clarifications to step 2. i've also added a legend for the chart by user amwijsman's suggestion. i didn't expect many people to find this, but thank you for all the love! \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.bromefields.com/curvy-eyelet-lace-knit-stitch/"
