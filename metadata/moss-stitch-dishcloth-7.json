  "notes": "the moss stitch is my go-to stitch whenever i want to crochet something easy.\r\n\r\ni wrote this pattern for a dishcloth using the moss stitch, because i think the fabric created from this stitch is a great option for a dishcloth.\r\nit is also a great option for a simple but elegant blanket, if you're looking for mindless crocheting!\r\n\r\ni think it looks so beautiful with multicolor yarn, but it will also look really good with a solid color."
