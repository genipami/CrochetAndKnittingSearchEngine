    "content": "the chicken squish is a round and cuddly new pal perfect for easter spring and barnyard fun bernat blanket makes this oversized amigurumi quicker than you d think to crochet as usual this squish is filled with a microbead pillow ball this one is a tight fit so it might fool you - but i love the firm feel if you like it a little softer you can use fiberfill or the filling of your choice or add another round to each piece of the body before the round with the wings for a looser fit"
