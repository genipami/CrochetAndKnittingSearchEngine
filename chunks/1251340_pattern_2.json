    "content": "the exact metal beads at hobby lobby that i used here in the pink and multicolored bracelets but i did find the same style on amazon and there are many other 4 mm bead options and styles to choose from to string the beads a yarn needle is typically too big i used a length of lightweight flexible beading wire folded in half to string the beads onto the yarn fishing wire or needle-eye dental flossies would also work the perlina beaded bracelet copyright \u00a9 june 2022 1 stitches used slip knot slip_stitch - slip_stitch single_crochet - single_crochet chain - chain *all notes here are based on my own stitch gauge being that a chain 3 is approximately 25 long you may need to experiment to get the right measurements for what you want * \u25cf not all brands of yarn weight 1 are equal i strung 5 5 of the same 4 mm beads and used the same 3 5 mm hook with loops and threads woolike simili-laine i ended up with 5 5 after the edging round but with hobby lobby yarn bee authentic hand-dyed tonal i had a slightly longer wider finished band it is not a huge difference but is something to keep in mind when using either a 3 5 mm hook or a 3 0 mm hook the top bracelet with woolike simi-laine is slightly narrower and daintier than the lower bracelet made with yarn bee authentic \u25cf for my bracelet at 5 5 long not including the button closure i strung beads or sets of beads that were 25 long for a total bead strand length of 5 5 or at least close to that - the yarn will be a bit forgiving and will relax a bit keep in mind that you ll need to factor in the length that sl sts and your closure will add \u25cf set of beads refers to a set of seed bead 4 mm bead seed bead that is approximately 25 long \u25cf if a single bead is already 25 long or at least close you don t need a set of beads or any accent seed beads unless you want to modify it won t fit nicely within the chain 3 \u25cf any mention of bead set or set of beads in the base construction steps is interchangeable depending on what you are using the instructions are the same whether you are using a single bead or a set of beads on your bead strand \u25cf be sure to string on the appropriate number of beads to match your desired final length it is better to add too many and not use them than to realize when you are finished that the piece isn t long enough since you ll have to undo a lot of your work to string on more factor in the bit of length that a closure and the sl sts will add even though they will be very tight and"
