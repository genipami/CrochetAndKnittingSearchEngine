  "notes": "sloth news!\r\npattern is correct from 9th october 16.00 bst, before then please look at the errata or download again\r\n\r\nclaire xxx\r\n\r\noctober 2023 #freebeefridayknits** - a free sloth!\r\ni read up about them and:\r\nfrom wiki: '... sloths are a neotropical group of xenarthran mammals constituting the suborder folivora, including the extant arboreal tree sloths and extinct terrestrial ground sloths.'\r\nhmm!\r\n\r\nanyway - my little guy is knitted as small as i could in alpaca yarn (just so he/ she has an element of fluffiness, sloths are soo hairy!)\r\n\r\nyou can, of course choose to knit yours with a larger gauge yarn on larger needles, there are some fine faux fur yarns out there! (... just saying/ would love to see someone knit a big one!)\r\n\r\nhe/ she is knitted in one piece - modular, so joining on parts as you go, as with probably all of my 'today' patterns.\r\n\r\nyou'll need some toy safety eyes - my ones are 8mm ones from etsy\r\n\r\nand it would be cool to add some wire or even magnets for huggable arms? on this occasion, i did use a wire armature and the instructions on how i did it and what wire i used are all written, with links to where i bought mine, in the pattern.\r\n\r\nand to end... some more sloth facts:\r\n\r\n1. everything is sluggish and slow-moving, even food digestion.\r\n2. they spend most of their lives hanging in the trees.\r\n3. they are incredibly picky when it comes to pooping. hey?!\r\n4. sloths are surprisingly good at swimming - that i didn't know!\r\n\r\nenjoy yours!\r\n x",
