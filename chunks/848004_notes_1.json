    "content": "these squiggly things have no practical use but they are very tactile objects they are fun to make and even more fun to play with they can be twisted and turned and it is very difficult to put them down once you pick them up technically they could be described as hyperbolic crochet the world expert on hyperbolic crochet is daina taimina 1 she has written several books and papers on the topic this pattern only aims to show what happens with different rates of increase it does not explain any of the maths there are instructions for several different squiggles based on circles and strips they work well in dk yarn but any type of yarn can be used thick yarns might soon become heavy to work with and more difficult to handle when the squiggle is finished the amount of yarn needed is set out in detailed tables **if you make only one i recommend the larger orange-edged version you will be amazed at just how much it twists and turns ** 1 https //www ravelry com/people/mathknit"
