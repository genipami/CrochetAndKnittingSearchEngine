  "notes": "this design was inspired by the wonderful british comedy television series “detectorists”.  based on the day-to-day lives of two friends, andy and lance, and their love of metal detecting weaves a story of mostly joy, friendship and humour with a few hiccups along the way.  andy and lance’s dream is to find the burial place of king sexred of the east saxons, thus the name of the pattern.  the scenes in the series are stunning as is the music and imagery.\r\n\r\nthese stranded colour work socks are worked toe up with a heel flap and gusset.  the socks are slightly “potato chippy”, just one more celtic motif.\r\n\r\nthe instructions for the construction of the socks are written and the colour work pattern is both written and charted.\r\n\r\nthis pattern was one of the finale patterns in  [supersock world championship ](/groups/supersock-world-championship) 2024.\r\n\r\na massive thank you to the secret testers (yarnymama, snsso, yalta and studio249) for their incredible feedback in helping me create this pattern.",
