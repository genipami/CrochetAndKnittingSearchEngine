    "content": "catesby three hour cowl by kathryn jones december 2011 1 skein 2 stitches 3 hours this is a very versatile pattern and works up super-quickly with aran or chunky yarn and a larger hook great for last minute presents you could also make a lighter cowl in dk or sock yarn with a longer chain or even an infinity scarf to wrap around twice with a very long starting chain it wouldn t take 3 hours though please note that if you want to make a longer cowl the starting chain needs to be a multiple of 10 stitches + 5 stitches this is a one-sided stitch pattern so it will not work for a scarf but i do think it would make a very nice cushion cover/ phone cosy/ laptop/ipad/kindle case if you were working the pattern flat rather than in the round you would then omit the slip-stitch section at the start yarn used 1 skein babylonglegs radiance aran in sterling 182 yards 100g yardage approx 150 200 yards aran weight yarn but stitch pattern can be easily adapted to use any yarn weight hook size and yardage skill level easy if you can do double and treble_crochet stitches single and double for us readers you can make this cowl once you have completed the first row it really is very easy just keep going until you run out of yarn time required 3 hours from start to finish but some of my speedier testers have finished it in only 2 hours if you are using a bulky/chunky yarn it will be even faster hook size i used a 7mm hook but also a slightly heavier weight of aran yarn if you are using a standard aran or worsted yarn or are in the us and cannot get hold of a 7mm hook you can switch to a 6 5mm hook and this will not greatly impact on the results stitches used slip-stitch sl-st double_crochet double_crochet treble treble_crochet this pattern uses uk crochet terms uk double_crochet = us single_crochet uk treble_crochet = us double_crochet the pattern chain 75 loosely it might help to go up one hook size for the chain if you want to make the chain longer or shorter please note it needs to be a multiple of 10 stitches + 5 stitches join ends with sl-st making sure not to twist the chain helpful tip if you have difficulty with not twisting the chain you could continue with the first row and then go back and join the chain afterwards just make sure to use stitch markers to mark both stitches you want to sl-st together stop to check the loop goes over your head and you are happy with the size happy let s move onto row 1 very important you will be working into the back loops only for the whole pattern this is what creates the raised wave effect row 1 - sl-st into first chain and each of the next 4"
