    "content": "easy tissue box cover using a modified granny square technique and double_crochet through the back loops to add stability written in uk terms i used a box of tissues measuring 23cm x 12cm x 7 5cm but there is a bit of give in the finished cover so don t worry if the measurements of your box aren t exactly the same you could add or subtract rounds to make the cover larger or smaller but try changing your hook size first it should be obvious by round eight whether you need to make any adjustments to the pattern yarn alternatives any aran or worsted weight yarn should work okay there are pictures on my blog of a variation of this pattern in aran weight acrylic"
