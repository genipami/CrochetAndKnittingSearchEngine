  "notes": "introducing my first ever crochet pattern! i created this for my boyfriend when he requested a crochet hat made with alpaca yarn. the alternating front and back post double crochet stitches create a thick and stretchy ribbing reminiscent of knit. i'm told it's warm and cozy. :) be sure to get the matching scarf for a set!\r\n\r\nthis hat was made especially for a man, but i think it would be suitable for women as well. the simple design is easy, and there are photos included to show the increasing rounds. the pattern can easily be customized to fit any head circumference. the amount of yarn listed is for an adult size.\r\n\r\n**stitches used:**\r\n\r\n* ch - chain dc - double crochet\r\n* fpdc - front post double crochet\r\n* bpdc - back post double crochet\r\n* sl st - slip stitch\r\n\r\n**materials:**\r\n\r\n* light worsted weight yarn in two\r\n  colors: 260 yards main color and 180\r\n  yards contrasting color\r\n* hook g (4.25mm)\r\n* yarn needle\r\n\r\n**gauge**\r\nthe pattern for the gauge is alternating front and back post double crochets for a total of 12 stitches, counting the initial ch-2 as a double crochet. this is repeated for 7 rows to measure 2\"x2\".\r\n"
