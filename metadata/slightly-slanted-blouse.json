  "notes": "the slightly slanted blouse\r\n\r\nwhen you have been crocheting as long as i have, stitches that used to feel new and exciting can start to feel boring and redundant. however, i’m always looking for new ways to see crochet, little shifts in perspective that make familiar stitches feel fresh again.\r\nthat’s what drew me to these slanted stitches. the way they tilt just slightly changes everything: solid stitches take on new depth, lace panels feel more alive, and the whole piece feels like it’s leaning into something playful and new. the slightly slanted blouse is my reminder that sometimes, a perspective shift can open up a world of possibility.\r\n\r\nfinished sizes:\r\ninstructions given to fit size x-small; changes for small, medium, large, x-large, 2x-large, 3x-large, 4x-large and 5x-large are in () \r\nxs (s, m, l, xl, 2xl, 3xl, 4xl, 5xl) \r\nbody circumference: 28” (33”, 36 ½”, 40”, 45 ¼”, 48 ½”, 52”, 57”, 60 ¾”)\r\nbody length: customizable. \r\nsleeve circumference: each size may choose whichever sleeve circumference they like from the following options: 12”, 15 ½”, 19”, & 22 ½”.\r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\ni used hobbii yarns azalea, which is a 52% cotton/48% acrylic #2 fine weight yarn. \r\nany yarn of similar weight would work. \r\napproximately 1000 (1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800) yds. \r\n4mm hook\r\n4.5mm hook\r\nstitch markers\r\nyarn needle\r\nscissors\r\nmeasuring tape\r\n\r\ndifficulty:\r\nintermediate - advanced\r\n\r\nthis pattern has been tested by a number of experienced crocheters and i have provided many pictures within the pattern to help you along the way. if you run into trouble you are free to message me for help.\r\n"
