  "notes": "due to the overwhelming interest in this hat, i have expanded the pattern to four sizes: baby, child, adult small, and adult large. in addition there have also been some other tweaks including a change to a more traditional gauge for worsted weight yarn. the original pattern is still available in the one size for those of you who liked it, and there is now a second pdf with the new sizes and updated pattern.\r\n\r\nsizes:\r\nbaby (child, adult small, adult large)\r\n13in (16in, 18.5in, 21in)\r\n33cm (40cm, 47cm, 53cm)\r\n"
