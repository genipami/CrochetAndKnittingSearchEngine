    "content": "this pattern is provided as part of a tutorial on crocheting in the 3rd loop the shell of the snail coaster is worked in the 3rd loop in a continuous round so it s an excellent way to practice this technique the coaster only uses a small amount of worsted weight yarn so it makes an excellent stash buster i used a size h 5 0mm crochet hook but you can use another hook since gauge is not crucial although if it s much smaller it won t work as a coaster you will also need a tapestry needle for weaving in ends and i recommend using a stitch marker to help you keep your place in the pattern ***you may not copy this pattern repost it anywhere either altered or in its original form or claim it as your own you may not use any photos on this site for your own use ***"
