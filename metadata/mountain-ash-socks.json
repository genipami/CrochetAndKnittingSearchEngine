  "notes": "> this was the december 2023 mystery sock for the [solidsocks](/groups/solidsocks) group. the pattern was released in 4 parts (\"clues\").\r\n\r\ni wanted to design something to showcase a lovely skein of dark green sock yarn. not too boring and not too tedious. i thoroughly enjoyed knitting this pattern, and i hope you will too!\r\n\r\ninstructions are provided for two sizes: s (m), with 64 (72) stitches per round. the pattern will incorporate increases and decreases to account for cables, so pick your usual stitch count. most of the pattern is charted only. you may use any technique you prefer for knitting a tube in the round.",
