  "notes": "this cozy earwarmer is a recreation of a fond memory i have from the pre-kids era, where i knit these by custom order. now that i have kids of my own, i decided to bring these back to keep their ears warm during the cold winters. \r\n\r\neveryday earwarmer wraps around the head from ear to ear, providing warmth while staying secure with ties under the chin. perfect for stash-busting, this project works beautifully with any yarn weight - from fingering to bulky - making it ideal for using up leftover yarn.\r\n\r\nworked flat from one i-cord tie to the other, the piece features triangular ear flaps shaped with increases and decreases, connected by a straight center panel over the crown. a slipped center stitch creates a clean vertical line through the ear flaps.\r\n\r\nthis pattern emphasizes flexibility and customization. measurements are guidance only - knit to your desired width and length, try on as you work, and achieve a perfect fit for any head size!\r\n\r\nnote: the earwarmers in the photos were knit using malabrigo rios (peachy, aquamarine) and linea boucle (ivory) with 4.5mm needles."
