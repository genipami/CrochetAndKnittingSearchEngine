    "content": "cord as long as you wish to suit your use the cord is made by twisting 4 lengths of yarn folding it in half and then letting them twist ply if you want a 30 inch cord you need to start with 2 5 times that length = 75 inches that is not 75 inches of yarn folded into 4ths it is 4 times 75 inches first you ll wind a butterfly this will allow the free end of lengths of yarn to untwist as you add twist to the starting end doesn t make sense does it bear with me starting about 24 inches from one end wind the remainder around your fingers this is the start of the butterfly wind the end around the butterfly and secure the end by looping it under the previous wrap pull tight when you need more length for twisting you can just pull it out of the butterfly without having to refasten anything so very handy pinch the starting end firmly start twisting the yarn counterclockwise letting the butterfly end be free to untwist i say clockwise because that is the direction that most yarn was last plied in twisting the same direction as the last plying makes a more attractive cord a minor distinction and it won t be a crime if you twist clockwise keep your fingers just a few inches apart it is easier to twist short segments than to twist the entire length at once when that length is fully twisted move down and twist some more i either have someone very patient hold the starting end or i clench it in my teeth be sure to not let go of this end or you will lose all of your twisting efforts you also need to keep it under gauge or it will start to kink up how much twist is enough it should be almost to the point where it kinks no matter how much gauge you put it under you can always test it by letting a short length fold in half it should be tightly plied the picture shows the test ply section with the twisted but not plied section above and the free end hanging down http //maiaspins typepad com/maiaspins/ ditty bags pattern page 6 of 6 revised march 29 2009 \u00a9 2009 maia discoe continue until the entire length is twisted fold in half placing the starting and ending ends together let go of the remainder it will ply in a swirling frenzy and probably not look like a cord at all no worries tie the starting and ending ends together so they won t untwist beginning at the knot end pull out the unwanted twistiness bit by bit with your fingers pull and smooth it into an even cord see all better i like to tie a knot at the non-knot end and trim the ends it is about symmetry not stability weave the cord in and out of the eyelet holes"
