    "content": "over the significance of the yo in step 1 this first yo enables us to hold a little bit of extra yarn on the hook in reserve and once the floating ring is complete we find that we have just the right amount of yarn perfectly positioned to complete the double crochet therefore the first yo and the floating ring are what allow us to break away directly to the center of the next motif without losing the capability of also making the double_crochet that stands between the very simple motif revisited remember our very simple motif from the beginning as far as breakaway crochet goes they re a thing of the past from now on we are going to make a motif that for all intents and purposes looks like the very simple motif but we are going to work it using the breakaway crochet techniques you have just learned and with a new way of working the very simple motif comes a new name for the motif training wheel even though we ve just covered a lot of new territory believe it or not the biggest difference between a very simple motif and a training wheel is in the way you start out that is to make a training wheel instead of doing all this step 1 chain 4 join with a slip_stitch to form a ring step 2 chain 3 you only have to do this step 1 1 fdc and from then on work all remaining double crochets into the floating ring section of the fdc full instructions are outlined below 10 training wheel instructions to make just 1 training wheel from start to finish begin by making a floating double_crochet step 1 fdc counts as the first double_crochet of the round and continue as usual step 2 15 double crochets in the floating ring that is at the base of the fdc step 3 slip_stitch into the top of the first double_crochet fasten_off 1 training wheel complete are we there yet ok now that it is indeed possible to jump from one motif to another using a continuous length of yarn let s go back to our original challenge and see if we can use our new skill to string a bunch of these motifs together let s give this a try step 1 training wheel step 2 training wheel step 3 training wheel whoops as you can see it s possible to make the first 2 training wheels as expected but the third one is another story once we finish the second one there s still the problem of the stitches and the hook being in totally the wrong place and not even a fdc will get us out of this pickle the final piece of the puzzle fortunately there is an answer all we have to do is get away from the idea that one motif must be completely finished before another one is started 11 too see what i mean and to"
