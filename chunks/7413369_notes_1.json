    "content": "these cute little cat toys are a perfect way to use up that scrap yarn you ve got lying around they work up really quick my average time is about half an hour from start to finish and you can use any kind of yarn you want it works best with worsted but you could get away with aran or dk or even holding multiple strands together for a chunkier toy note try to keep your first four stitches fairly loose as i ve found that my method of casting on makes four kfb in a row really hard on the hands and needles"
