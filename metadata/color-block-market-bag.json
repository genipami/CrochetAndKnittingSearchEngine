  "notes": "note: want to make these bags and sell them? go for it! i love it! just include pattern attribution somewhere on the tag or at your stall (e.g \"pattern by mushrump\" or \"pattern by jenn fox\"). you are also welcome to use this pattern for teaching and sharing purposes. have fun!\r\n\r\nthis bright, contemporary-but-classic market bag is great for trips to the farmers’ market, the beach, the library, or for a sunny downtown stroll!\r\n\r\nconstructed with sturdy worsted-weight cotton, it uses basic chains and double crochet stitches to form a simple square mesh pattern. the solid single crochet bottom creates a sturdy base, and the straps can be altered to the crocheter’s preferred length.\r\n\r\nthe finished bag measures approximately 13\" tall by 16\" wide, not including the straps. this may vary depending on your stitch tension and yarn choice.",
