  "notes": "i love dk socks. they knit up fast, and they are so cosy and warm to wear when staying home – which most of us are doing a lot of right now… \r\n\r\nat the close of this challenging year, i wanted to give you a little nugget of warmth and love, from my heart(h) to yours. \r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy knitting these for yourself, or perhaps as a comforting gift for a loved one. the light texture make the rounds addictive – just like a little pile of biscuits that we might enjoy going through as we knit and sip on our favourite warm beverage.\r\n\r\nthe biscuit socks are knit cuff down in a heavy sport to dk yarn. \r\nyou will find 2 separate sets of instructions - one file for double-pointed needles, and one for circular needles. the pattern comes in 2 sizes.\r\n\r\nif you share your biscuit socks and wips on instagram, i would be most grateful if you tagged me @fluffyfibers and used the #biscuitsocks hashtag. \r\n"
