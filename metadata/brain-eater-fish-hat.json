  "notes": "the brain eater hat came into being a few years ago when my grandson was into monsters.  i remembered when i was a kid and my brother would put his hand on my head and ask \"what's this?\" to which he would then add, \"it's a brain eater and it's starving!\"  as annoying as it was for me as a child, it is one of those silly little memories that i look back on now and smile.  \r\nthis is my third time making it and i finally wrote the pattern down as i went.\r\n\r\nmaterials needed:\r\nworsted weight yarn - two different shades of blue (or color of your choice), white, red, black & yellow\r\nhooks - 5.5mm for body, and 4.5mm for all other parts\r\nscissors, yarn needle, stitch marker\r\n\r\npattern is worked from the top down and each round is joined with a slip stitch.\r\nusing the 5.5mm hook and worsted weight yarn you will end up with a hat that should fit up to a 23 inch head.   a larger hook will make a larger hat, as a smaller hook will make a smaller hat.  also, a thinner yarn (dk for example) will probably end up with a slightly smaller hat as well.\r\nsmaller sizes could be made by decreasing the amount of increase rounds.\r\ngauge is not really important.\r\ni have found over the many times i have made this hat, that a 5mm hook works quite well for a medium sized hat.\r\nthere is a typo in the pattern - when making the esca (lure) it reads round 11 after rounds 6-12, this obviously should be round 13.",
