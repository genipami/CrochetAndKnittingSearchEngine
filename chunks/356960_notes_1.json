    "content": "this is a simple and quick crown pattern to finish off a last-minute costume or to add to a dress-up box the pattern was originally made for a child but adult sizing information can be found italicized in parentheses in the pattern basically the adult size simply has longer straps than the child s size the gauge is not too important but keep an eye on the length of the straps the straps in the child-size pattern and picture are just over 6 5 inches long **update ** i updated the pattern to lengthen the straps as they were a little on the short size previously i am unsure of the yardage for this pattern as i made it using a partial skein of leftover crochet thread let me know if you have any questions"
