    "content": "of the patterning would happen if you were to work a sock in a lace cable or colour work design the leg can be worked as long as you fancy within reason obviously - i personally like my socks longer and would normally work around 60 64 rounds for the leg but anything will be ok on a basic sock you could actually skip the leg completely and go straight to the heel after the cuff if you wanted to work tiny short sneaker socks or if you have worked a very long cuff instead but these would be extreme variations round 1 k to end repeat until desired leg length heel flap ah yes the heel the part of a sock that can strike fear into even seasoned knitters if you look at the anatomy of a human foot you will notice that it makes a change in direction short- ly after the ankle part the foot is positioned at nearly 90 degrees to the leg and anything that is designed to cover the whole foot will have to take this into account and allow for it in its structure hence the heel there is a myriad of heel versions available to the adventurous sock knitter but as stated above we will deal with the classic flap & gusset option for now as the name suggests it mainly consists of a flap and a gusset and the flap is worked first it is basically just a rectangular piece of fabric but even here we have some options the flap is worked over half your leg stitches with the other half parked for now for the instep so 32 +32 sts in my example you will now knit over the 32 sts of needle 1 in row back and forth until you have a piece that is deep enough to accommodate your heel the higher your instep the longer the heel flap needs to be but as a rule of thumb a flap that is roughly square will work for most people the plainest of flaps is simply worked in stocking stitch i e the rs row are knit the ws row are purl as we will have to pick up stitches along the sides later the first st of each row will be slipped to give us a neat chain edge that is easy to pick up sock page 4 however as the heel is one of the points where people might put extra strain on their socks it is also one of the parts that can wear out more quickly than say the leg as its position in the sock makes it quite difficult to replace it is a good practice to work a re-enforced heel flap instead this involves slipping every other st in the k row which creates a layer of yarn floats on the inside of the sock that will strengthen and cushion the flap row 1 sl1 kwise sl1 pwise k1 to last st"
