  "notes": "finished measurements\r\nwidth: 6’’, length: 4½’’\r\n\r\npattern notes\r\nthis dragon is worked in a continuous spiral. the snout is the only part that is worked in an oval spiral. join rounds with a slip stitch only where indicated.\r\n\r\ni use the “yarn under, yarn over” method of crocheting when using chunky chenille yarn. this creates a pretty, slanted x-shaped stitch. yarning under also creates tighter tension. you may crochet however you’d like but note that the gauge may be affected.\r\n\r\nhere’s a helpful video on the yarn under, yarn over method: https://www.instagram.com/reel/cp0dbpraa_d/\r\n\r\nrather than using a magic ring, use a ch 2 when beginning spiral pieces when working with this type of chenille yarn. this will prevent the yarn from snagging.\r\n\r\nwhen changing colors at the end of a round, finish the final pull-through of the last stitch of the round with the new color. cut the old color and secure it in a knot. since the inside of the amigurumi will not be visible, there is no need to weave in the ends.\r\n\r\nto clean up the color changes of the belly, cut 12 inches of cc1 and weave over the edges using backstitches.\r\n\r\nskills/techniques used in this pattern:\r\n• chain, single, and double crochet stitches.\r\n• bobbles.\r\n• decreases.\r\n• working in continuous rounds.\r\n• surface single crochet.\r\n• seaming.\r\n\r\nmaterials\r\npremier® yarns parfait® chunky (100% polyester, 3.5oz / 100g, 131yds / 120m\r\n • (mc): 1150-30 emerald – 1 ball\r\n • (cc2): 1150-01 white – 1 ball\r\npremier® yarns parfait® chunky glitz (94% polyester, 6% silver glitter, 3.5oz / 100g, 109yds / 100m\r\n • (cc1): 2135-08 key lime glitz – 1 ball\r\npremier® yarns little bunny solids and multis (100% polyester, 3.5oz / 100g, 109yds / 100m\r\n • (cc3): 2079-01 white – 1 ball\r\nhook: us size g (4 mm) or size needed to obtain gauge\r\nnotions: tapestry needle, 1 removable stitch marker, fabric glue, black embroidery thread, 2 -10 mm x 8mm oval safety eyes"
