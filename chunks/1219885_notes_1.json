    "content": "this is a simple fair isle cowl pattern i designed to knit for the woolly thistle s 2022 colorwork accessory knit-a-long though this chart has a couple of nine-stitch stretches it s a good learning project for catching floats without being overwhelming as most of the other rounds have five or less stitches of one color in a round a cowl is a great first project for knitters new to stranded colorwork there is no shaping to worry about and it s a fairly quick project they also make a great swatch when trying new yarns or if you want to sample an old favorite on a new needle size as i did here i usually knit jamieson and smith on 2 75mm but wanted to try 3mm needles i m glad i did i like the fabric very much i may go a step further and try on 3 25 in another cowl"
