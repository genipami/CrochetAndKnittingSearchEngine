  "notes": "when thinking about what i wanted to do for my first contribution to the year of hats, i took a bunch of elements of knitting i really, really love - a folded brim, textured stitches, stripes, and a pom pom - and incorporated them all into the design. \r\n\r\n**worthy of note**\r\nthis hat begins with a [provisional cast on][1], then a deep folded brim is worked in a k1, p1 ribbing. once the ribbing is complete, the provisional cast on is unpicked and placed on a spare circular needle and the stitches are joined to created a [folded brim][2]. \r\n\r\nafter the brim is complete, the body of the hat is worked in a texture stripe pattern from a chart. the chart is worked 4 times around. decreases shape the crown and a pom pom completes the look.\r\n\r\n*please note:* this is not a beginner pattern, but it is a great introduction to working from charts. both the body of the hat and the crown decreases are worked from a chart. \r\n\r\n**specifications\r\nyarn**\r\nkelbourne woolens germantown (100% n. american wool; 200 yds/100 gm skein): pebble 059, 1 skein.\r\n**gauge**\r\n18 sts + 32 rnds = 4” (10 cm) in body chart pattern on larger ndls, after blocking.\r\n**needles**\r\n1 – 16” (40 cm) us 4 (3.5 mm) circular. \r\n1 – 16” (40 cm) us 6 (4 mm) circular.\r\n1 – set us 6 (4 mm) dpns.\r\n*check your gauge and adjust needle size(s) accordingly if necessary.*\r\n**notions**\r\nsize g crochet hook, spare us 6 (4 mm) circular, waste yarn, stitch marker, tapestry needle, kelbourne woolens label, sewing thread, sharp sewing needle.\r\n**size**\r\n19.5” (49.5 cm) circumference, unstretched, 9.5” (24 cm) height.\r\n**skills**\r\nknit, purl patterning from charts, provisional cast on.\r\n\r\nimage: linette kielinski\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://kelbournewoolens.com/tips-and-tricks/provisional-cast-on/\r\n  [2]: https://kelbournewoolens.com/tips-and-tricks/folded-brim",
