    "content": "you are invited to a wonder-full woolgatherer holiday season everybody welcome while the pattern instructions are broken down into 24 bitesize sections to work your way through this doesn t mean that you are limited to using a 24 day advent calendar of course it would work perfectly with 24 different mini skeins in fact i specifically played around with the construction to make sure that it looks great whether your surprise colours end up forming a fade or whether they are more of a random selection but the design would also suit a 12 day advent calendar combined with a main colour or you could not be using an advent calendar at all - the pattern would also look super effective worked up using 8 colours or 4 colours with one main colour so many options whether you re looking for a daily project to see you through advent or you ll be whizzing through it all as fast as possible you can guarantee this will be an enjoyable knit not only is it broken up into small manageable sections but there s not a purl stitch in sight **yarn requirements** you will need roughly 200-240g fingering weight yarn in total 24 x 8-10g minis or 12 x 8-10g minis and 100-120g mc or 8 x 25-30g balls or 4 x 25-30g balls and 100-120g mc eta 23/11/24 i am so pleased to announce that this pattern is now also available in french thank you so much to the wonderful caribouc for your translation skills"
