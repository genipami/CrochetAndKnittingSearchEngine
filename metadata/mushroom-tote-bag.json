  "notes": "alright y'all, as asked for on reddit, here's what i've written up for my mushroom tote bag! please let me know if you have any questions about the pattern.\r\n\r\nfinished, this bag is about 12 inches wide by 12 inches tall (excluding handles) when laid flat. you most definitely can choose other yarns and colors (cotton yarn might actually be a better material choice than acrylic, but acrylic was what i had on hand). you could also make all the mushrooms one color, and not have to worry so much about joining them in the right order.\r\n\r\nenjoy! please post pictures if you end up making this!\r\n\r\n**you may sell finished items from my pattern, but please credit me & this pattern in your listing. of course, no selling the pattern itself. thanks!",
