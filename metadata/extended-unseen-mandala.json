  "notes": "> a free version of this pattern is\r\n> available on my website in three parts. the paid-for version\r\n> includes written instructions, charts, and lots of photos to help you along the way.\r\n\r\nthis is an extended version of the [unseen mandala][1] i designed three years ago.  the words i spoke then ring just as true now:\r\n\r\n\"during these last few months, i have thought a lot about the hidden (unseen) things people go through; some of them temporary, and some of them life-long battles.  \r\n\r\nregardless of the extent/seriousness/duration, hidden things carry a burden very different from that of visible things.  and if they are hidden even from ourselves, whether that is simply because we don’t have names for them yet, or because we do not want to acknowledge them, that burden becomes even heavier.\r\n\r\ni designed this mandala to acknowledge the hidden and unseen, both in others and in ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n**details**\r\n\r\nthis mandala is a 51-round mandala, designed to be stretched on a 85cm/33.5\" hoop and used as a wall hanging.  \r\n\r\nthe pattern contains bobble stitches, popcorn stitches, puff stitches, front post/back post stitches, and pineapple stitches.\r\n\r\nalthough it is an intermediate pattern, it has been written for adventurous beginners, with plenty of photos and hints.\r\n\r\nenjoy!\r\n\r\ndedri\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/unseen-mandala"
