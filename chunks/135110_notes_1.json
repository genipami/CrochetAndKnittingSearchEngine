    "content": "most of the hats i ve come across are just basic hats in canada or any colder climate i ve found that basic hats don t always cut it there s something extra about a hat with ear flaps your ears stay warm and being able to tie it under your chin keeps the wind out just that much more effectively when i started knitting i couldn t find a pattern for an ear flap hat that i really liked i experimented and made a bunch for friends this basic pattern is the result of that experimentation enjoy i like my hats a bit longer so that the ear flaps cover right down to my jaw line they keep the wind out better in cold winters so keep that in mind when using my guidelines as always adjust to your tastes edit - pattern updated january 23 2010 to correct minor errors during brim assembly pdf v1 2"
