  "notes": "materials \r\n- 2 (3, 3) skeins of purl soho and earthstar farm’s [big mountain cormo worsted][1], 100% undyed cormo wool yarn. each skein of this worsted weight yarn is 110 yards/ 50 grams; approximately 220 (245, 270) total yards required. we used the colors swan and dove.\r\n- us 6 (4 mm), 24-inch [circular knitting needles][2]\r\n- us 7 (4.5 mm), 24-inch circular needles\r\n- a [cable stitch holder][3]\r\n- [stitch holders][4] or scrap yarn\r\n\r\nnote: if you’re knitting the medium size, you may not need the 3rd skein (we used every last bit of 2 skeins, plus an extra few yards for our dove sample). if you don’t end up needing it, you can return unwound yarn for a refund within 30 days of purchase, or within 6 months, for store credit. our [return policy][5] has all the details!\r\n\r\ngauge\r\n\r\n30 stitches and 28½ rows = 4 inches in repeating cable, on larger needles\r\n\r\n30 stitches and 32 rows = 4 inches in ribbing, on smaller needles\r\n\r\nnote: to check your gauge (and not run out of yarn!), we recommend casting on and knitting the pattern for a few inches, then place your work on scrap yarn without cutting the main yarn and block your piece. if necessary, frog and re-knit on different needles.\r\n\r\nsizes \r\n\r\nsmall (medium, large)\r\n\r\nto fit actual neck circumference of 11½– 13½ (13½–15½, 15½ -17½) inches. (if you’re between two sizes and want to style your scarf with both ends even, we recommend going up one size. before moving on to the final ribbing section, try it on and check the fit!)\r\n\r\nfinished dimensions: 4½ inches wide x 30½ (33, 35½) inches long\r\n\r\nsamples: the swan sample is the small size, and the dove sample is the medium size.\r\n\r\npattern designed and written by purl soho designer, [hiromi glover][6]. see even more of hiromi’s work [on her instagram][7]!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.purlsoho.com/big-mountain-cormo-worsted.html\r\n  [2]: https://www.purlsoho.com/tools-and-notions/collection_filter--circular_needles.html\r\n  [3]: https://www.purlsoho.com/tools-and-notions/collection_filter--stitch_holders.html\r\n  [4]: https://www.purlsoho.com/tools-and-notions/collection_filter--stitch_holders.html\r\n  [5]: https://www.purlsoho.com/return-policy\r\n  [6]: https://www.purlsoho.com/create/tag/hiromi-glover-for-purl-soho/\r\n  [7]: https://www.instagram.com/mignonnegrise/"
