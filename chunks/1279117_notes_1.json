    "content": "this pattern can be adapted to use any yarn it has been written using an aran weight yarn and a 5mm hook but you can use other yarn for this i recommend using a hook size relevant for the yarn * double knit 3 5mm - 4 5mm * aran 4 5 - 5 5mm * bulky 5 5mm - 6 5mm but you will know what best suits you what you are want for this pattern is not to see the stuffing if you do you need to go down a hook size remember for finer yarn e g dk you may need extras chains to start with and if using a bulky weight yarn you may need less chains have fun testing this out until you get your perfect pumpkin if you want a taller pumpkin this crochet less row and join as described and play with colour i have a pink pumpkin"
