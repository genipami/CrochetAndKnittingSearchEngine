  "notes": "i love knitting socks of all kinds – from the very simple to the very complex. when i need something basic, i cast on a pair of ribbed socks in a colourway that pleases me. ribbing is no more difficult than plain stockinette and can likewise be used with solid or multi-coloured sock yarns of any kind, but adds extra snugness in the fit. \r\n\r\nfeel free to use your choice of fingering weight yarn! something that works well at 8 sts/inch is best.\r\n\r\nthis is a basic, cuff-down, 3x1 ribbed sock pattern with a flap heel and gussets. it is written for fingering-weight yarn for one size of 64 sts around, to fit foot/ankle circumference of 8-9 inches. to accommodate smaller or larger foot sizes, decrease or increase the number of cast-on stitches by a multiple of 4. \r\n\r\n*please note i am not able to guarantee pattern support for free patterns after their 1st year of release. \r\nthis pattern was originally released in 2010.*\r\n",
