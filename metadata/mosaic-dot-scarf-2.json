  "notes": "looking for a new cowl or scarf pattern to keep your neck cozy? how about one that looks a bit fancy, but is actually very simple to knit? well grab some needles and check out our mosaic dot scarf!\r\n\r\nthis baby is a breeze to knit, and is a great introduction to mosaic knitting, a technique that i like to refer to as \"cheat's colourwork\". it is a technique that gives you the complexity of multi-coloured patterns, with the simplicity of using just one yarn at a time! the dot pattern itself zooms along thanks to several plain knit rows and the incentive that comes with knitting stripes (\"oh, i'll just knit one more row!\"), but still has a bit going on to keep it interesting.\r\n\r\nwe encourage you to get as creative as you like with the colours. think 1 main and 1 contrast (like our coral version), swap the main and contrast halfway through (like our blue one), or stripe lots of different colours in the background while using up some stash.\r\n\r\nthe pattern has been designed so it can be knit in 4ply, 8ply, 10ply or 14ply yarns - all you need to do is choose your weight and favourite colours, then dive right in!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**materials**\r\n\r\n**dimensions:** approximately 20-22cm wide x 140cm long (cowl) or 180cm long (scarf)\r\n\r\n**materials:** yarn needle for sewing up\r\n\r\n**4ply / fingering version**\r\n**yarn:** any 4ply / fingering weight yarn\r\n**quantity:** \r\nmc: approximately 350-400m\r\ncc: approximately 250-400m\r\n**needle:** 3.50mm needle\r\n**gauge:** 28sts to 10cm in mosaic pattern\r\n\r\n**8ply / dk version**\r\n**yarn:** any 8ply / dk weight yarn\r\n**quantity:** \r\nmc: approximately 200-275m\r\ncc: approximately 175-275m\r\n**needle:** 4.50mm needle\r\n**gauge:** 20sts to 10cm in mosaic pattern\r\n\r\n**10ply / worsted or aran version**\r\n**yarn:** any 10ply / worsted or aran yarn\r\n**quantity:** \r\nmc: approximately 190-250m\r\ncc: approximately 150-250m\r\n**needle:** 5.50mm needle\r\n**gauge:** 17sts to 10cm in mosaic pattern\r\n\r\n**14ply / chunky version**\r\n**yarn:** any 14ply / bulky weight yarn\r\n**quantity:** \r\nmc: approximately 150-200m\r\ncc: approximately 100-200m\r\n**needle:** 8.00mm needle\r\n**gauge:** 12sts to 10cm in mosaic pattern\r\n\r\nplease note that yardage is loosely estimated due to the different combinations of colours and lengths possible. but if it helps, using only one main colour throughout should use about 60% mc and 40% cc. or if you swap your main and contrast colours halfway like we did, you should use a pretty even amount of each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**samples**\r\nour blue & white 10ply sample was made in bc garn northern lights, colours 1 cream and 17 light blue (1 skein each).\r\n\r\nour coral & pink 4ply sample was made in ochre yarns 306, colours 109 pomegranate (365m) and 105 blossom (212m)",
