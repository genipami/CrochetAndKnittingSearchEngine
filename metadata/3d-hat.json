  "notes": "this slouchy beanie features the words delay - deny - depose around the lower edge. above this border, skulls bloom from leafy stalks. \r\n\r\nif you want to knit the beanie without the words, an alternative chart with snowflakes is included in the pattern. \r\n\r\nthe yardage breakdown is as follows: \r\n\r\nmain colour (green) 110m /120 yards \r\ncontrast colour 1 (natural) 95m/104 yards \r\ncontrast colour 2 (bronze) 5m/6 yards\r\n\r\nthe sample hat was knitted in rauma finullgarn, 175m/50g. finull is a woollen-spun rustic norwegian yarn that knits up much more robustly and thickly than a worsted-spun merino yarn of the same yardage and weight.",
