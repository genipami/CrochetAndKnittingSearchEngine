  "notes": "this year's little mystery pattern was extracted from one of my first patterns: [butterfly 40](/patterns/library/butterfly-40-2).\r\n\r\nlearn more about ashlee's mystery designs at [https://ashleeslint.com/2023/11/07/october-mystery-patterns/][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nthere are **two files included** in this listing:\r\n\r\n- interlocking crochet: fully written pattern and chart\r\n- overlay mosaic crochet: fully written pattern and x-marked chart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***important details***\r\n\r\n**interlocking crochet**\r\n• chart is 41 x 41\r\n• finished size 10” / 26cm\r\n• 4.5 mm hook (us7)\r\n• worsted weight yarn (200 - 225 yards total)\r\no main color (mc) (dark lines) – 100 yards plus 25 yards for\r\noptional border\r\no accent color (ac) (background) – 100 yards\r\n• gauge: 8 (dc, ch) x 8 rows = 4”\r\n\r\n**overlay mosaic crochet**\r\n• chart is 37 x 37\r\n• size without fringe or border: 10.5” x 10” / 27cm x 25cm\r\n• 5 mm hook (h-8)\r\n• worsted weight yarn (130 – 230 yards total)\r\no main color (dark lines) – 50 yards\r\no contrasting color (background) – 80 yards\r\no optional envelope border – 100 yards\r\n• gauge: 14 stitches x 15 rows = 4”\r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\n**techniques**\r\n\r\nthe locked filet mesh (lfm) interlocking crochet method uses only chain spaces and double crochets to create a mesh; two colors are worked alternately which creates the pattern.\r\n\r\nmosaic crochet is single crochet and double crochet stitches. the double crochet stitches cover some of the other color's single crochet stitches to create the design. my patterns instruct you to cut your yarn at the end of each row. the back is striped but often gives a faint impression of the pattern on the front (sort of like illusion knitting).\r\n____\r\n\r\ni have youtube tutorials available for both crochet methods! follow this link to get to my youtube channel and find my other social links: [https://ashleeslint.com/link-in-bio][2]\r\n_____\r\n\r\n**testers**\r\n\r\nthank you to my testers: cyncitycrochet, deahanna hernandez lieb, erin carlson, eva, henriette van wyck, kim b, marie sparks, nancy mckain, sonjia schultz, and teresa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n©️ ashlee brotzell 2025.\r\nall rights reserved. this publication is protected under federal copyright laws. reproduction or distribution, in whole or in part, in any medium, is strictly prohibited.\r\n\r\nwhat does this mean?\r\nthis is an original pattern by ashlee brotzell. you may not copy, reproduce, sell, or share any part of it whether for profit or not. this includes, but is not limited to, the written pattern, the chart, and the photos. no translations or video tutorials are allowed.\r\n\r\nsales of your finished items are, of course, unrestricted (and i wish you all the best!). i appreciate credit given to the designer when possible but it is not a requirement. you may tag me @ashleeslint or direct people to my website [www.ashleeslint.com][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://ashleeslint.com/2023/11/07/october-mystery-patterns/\r\n  [2]: https://ashleeslint.com/link-in-bio/\r\n  [3]: https://ashleeslint.com/"
