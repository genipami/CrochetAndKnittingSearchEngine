    "content": "this pretty lacy top is created top-down and in one piece so you can try it on as you go instructions are given for adding waist shaping and a slight flare for the hips all of which is of course optional made at a smaller gauge than my feather and fan top this one uses fingering to sport weight yarn for the smaller sizes the pattern is given in one size small but it easily made in sizes up to 36 or so without increasing the yarn weight for larger sizes follow the instructions in the pattern to find your target gauge and try a sport to dk range and a larger hook **a gauge swatch is essential for this pattern ** i would call this an intermediate pattern you should be comfortable making triples and will have to pay attention to where you place your stitches especially when adding shaping please feel free to contact me if you have questions enjoy"
