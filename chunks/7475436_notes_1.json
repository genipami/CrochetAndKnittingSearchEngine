    "content": "the sweater is designed to hang on a cord to make christmas bunting but it can also be used to make christmas tree ornaments or to dress toys with my knitting group was tasked to make christmas buntings to hang in our local shop windows i wanted to knit a row of little sweaters but the patterns i found were quite small and i doubted they would be visible to passersby plus i needed a design that would hang nicely from the curved bunting cord i couldn t find exactly what i needed and with inspiration from sue stratford s mini christmas jumper bunting i wrote this pattern it is knitted in one piece and by finishing off with kitchener stitch or a 3 needle bind off there are no seams to sew up - that s right - no seams to sew up the pattern is free so why not download it and have some fun knitting a couple or more sweaters for yourself or a friend"
