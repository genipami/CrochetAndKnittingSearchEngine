  "notes": "materials needed\r\n\r\n6.0mm crochet hook (j)\r\nworsted #4 weight yarn - approx 110 yards or less\r\nscissors\r\nyarn needle\r\nstitch markers (optional)\r\ndecorative beads (optional)\r\n\r\nskill level\r\n\r\nintermediate\r\n\r\npattern info\r\n\r\nthis dragon scale pouch is worked from bottom to top. it also works in the round. unless you are changing colors, it is worked as one piece.\r\n\r\nfull 6 page pattern with photo reference guides, and examples along the way\r\n\r\npattern is easily adjustable if you want to make a smaller or larger pouch. a great suggestion would be using a dk weight yarn used with a 5mm hook, or you could even double strand worsted yarn/use bulky yarn to get a larger pouch as well. in that case i would give a suggestion for a 6.5mm-9mm hook range (whatever you feel gives you the right tension you desire)\r\n\r\nthis pattern is worked in a medium to loose tension. if you find you have a tighter tension, you can adjust hook sizes slightly larger as needed.\r\napprox measurements are given for the first base rounds before starting the \"body\" of the pouch. \r\nthe finished pouch if worked with worsted yarn should yield approx 5.5\"-6\" tall depending on tension.\r\n\r\nthe more firm your yarn, the sturdier your pouch will stand/be on its own. softer/flimsier yarns don't hold shape as well, however, still work up lovely.\r\n\r\nthere are some fun & textured stitches to this pattern, however each is fully described as well as photo examples.\r\n\r\nany photos within this pattern are the sole copyrighted property of wickedly handmade. if you so wish, please share the link to the pattern as it is a fun and free download :)\r\nthis pattern is not for resale, as it is a free pattern, however items made using the pattern can be sold by the maker. if you would like to give us a shoutout, you can do so by tagging either wickedly handmade’s facebook page or instagram handle.\r\nfeel free to use the hashtag #mysticaldragonscalepouch so we can see your beautiful work!\r\n\r\nthank you so much for choosing our pattern, and we hope you love it! if there are any questions, feel free to contact us at any time by email, through our facebook page, or through our instagram page. we will do our best to reply as quickly as possible!",
