    "content": "i love having socks on my needles that are easy to pick up when i only have time to knit a few row or to bring along with me these socks are knit using a super easy-to-remember pattern with gorgeous texture that is great for any type of fingering weight yarn - whether it be self-striping tonal or speckled these socks are just as easy to knit as vanilla socks but alot more fun and result in a better fitting sock too in my opinion **the pattern is written with the texture pattern all around the sock on all 4 needles but you can also choose to knit the pattern only on the front needles 1 and 2 and knit the back needles 3 and 4 in stockinette as i did in the picture shown ** as i was knitting these socks the little block pattern reminded me of library books stacked on a shelf and besides what s more enjoyable than cozying up with a knitting project and your favourite book the pattern is written to be knit using dpns but can modified to knit using magic loop or circular needles the pattern is for an adult medium sock but can be easily be modified to knit a larger or smaller sock so grab your needles some yarn from your stash and get ready to cast on with me"
