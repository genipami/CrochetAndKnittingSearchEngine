  "notes": "blend modern style with tradition to create this lively crochet blanket. using 2 mixes of red heart bitty stripes you'll create simple granny squares with gorgeous color. practice working motifs in the round, plus partial motifs in rows for half and quarter shapes. alternate 2 rounds from one ball with 2 from the other to reveal a fun, random color mix. simply join your squares in a diamond tile pattern to complete this dynamic throw."
