    "content": "foot as to not interrupt the design but for basic socks the classic position is either side of the foot between the sole and the instep i have worked my gusset in reverse stocking st on the anatomy sample on the last page to make it clearly visible but normally the gusset is in the same stitch pattern as the sole and will not be perceived as an independent feature when you are adept at knitting socks you will probably be able to place this instinctively but for now we will place a stitch marker either side to place the decreases correctly with needle 1 k until you come to the st that you have made from the gap between the heel and the instep this is one st before the instep so you should have 16+1=17 sts left on your left needle k2tog place your first marker k the remaining 15 sts on needle 1 sock page 6 with needle 2 k 15 place your second marker ssk k to end this was your first decrease round and you have decreased the stitch count by 2 knit one round without decreasing slipping your markers as you get to them decrease round k to 2 sts before first marker k2tog sl marker k to end of needle 1 on needle 2 k to marker sl marker ssk k to end of round you will now alternate between decrease rounds and rounds without decreasing until you are back to the number of sts that you have worked your leg with 64 in our sample case there is a possibility for bespoke adjustment here if you have very slender legs and ankles but rath- er wide feet you could stop your decreases earlier to leave you more sts for the foot circumference alternatively if you have fairly substantial ankles but tiny narrow feet you simply decrease further until you have the number that fits you feet better in reality though the vast majority of people will be best served to work leg and foot of their socks with the same number foot this is nice and easy as for the leg simply work in straight rounds of knitting until the foot portion is long enough for your foot in the commercial size tables there will be a measurement for foot length but all you need is length of your foot from heel to great toe taken on the sole of the foot and subtract about 2 inches 5 cms to allow for the toe section so if your foot measures 26 cms stop knitting your foot when your sock measures 21 cms from the back of the heel to the needles toe to finish your first sock you will just need to work the toe cap and it will not come as a massive sur- prise to you to learn that here too there are numerous options and shapes that can be employed we will here work the so-called chisel toe with"
