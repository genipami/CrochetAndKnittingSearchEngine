  "notes": "here is a freebie snoopy pattern for all of you!\r\ni've always wanted to give back to the crochet community, without the generosity of others sharing their knowledge i never would have learned what i know now! i hope this pattern brings you some joy, im excited to share it!\r\n\r\nbasic crochet skills are required. pattern includes simplified instructions in a math format ex: mr 6, inc x 6, and photos of all the parts.\r\n\r\nlike most amigurumi the size options are pretty flexible, i used worsted weight yarn and a 4.25 mm hook but feel free to play with different yarns and hooks to create a whole new look!\r\n\r\nhappy crocheting <3 \r\nand feel free to share your creations with me on here or instagram **@astitchinthedark**\r\n~vikki davis~",
