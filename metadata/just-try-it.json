  "notes": "took a cowl over for a friend. \r\n\r\nasked her silver-haired, bike-riding, ultra marathon-running (100k) husband if he'd wear one - he just spluttered. \r\n\r\n**so i asked him to try it on** - \r\nwithin less than a minute **he** was explaining to me in great technical detail why this was the perfect item for all of his outdoor pursuits. \r\n\r\nhonestly, much more practical for active guys than a scarf - **if only you can get them to try....** \r\n\r\n**for snow clearing**: it can be pulled up over the face\r\n**for wood-cutting**: no danger of it getting caught in the chainsaw\r\n\r\nsome of the guys like a closer-fit, so i added a tighter \"guy\" size. \r\n\r\nsizes ladies might like are included too. \r\n\r\n**many thanks to the testers (and their male models ☺):**\r\nspikeysandy\r\nknitgrl\r\nxstitch\r\npaulinespinks\r\nskyhooked\r\nwireknitter\r\nunitwo\r\nsymonangel (with her own gift of grace handspun)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/the-long-and-winding-row",
