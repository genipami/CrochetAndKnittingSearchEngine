  "notes": "that first wintry morning when all is white and frozen. the trees and all the plants are covered in hoar-frost. \r\n\r\na very simple vine lace pattern adds a sweet detail to an otherwise vanilla sock. the lace pattern is easy to memorize and knit. the sample knit in blue, only one lace panel was knit on the front of the sock. the sample knit in speckled yarn has two lace panels knit on the front of either sides of the sock. the pattern only written for one size but it is adjustable. the lace is charted and the sock is knit on circular needles, magic loop. it can be adapted to dpns. \r\n\r\n\r\nthis pattern has not been tech edited or test knit, please get in touch with me if there are any issues. happy knitting!",
