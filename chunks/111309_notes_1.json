    "content": "this pattern is without gauge but that does not mean it is not measured i used almost 2 1/2 skeins of paton regular merino and about less than one skein for the contrasting color depending on the size of the fringe you may need more yarn or not the scarves i have made come to about 60 to 62 inches before blocking and at least 65 inch scarf after blocking it also has a numerological cabalistical and magical touch to it"
