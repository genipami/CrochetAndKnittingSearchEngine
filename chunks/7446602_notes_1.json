granted that s why i ve been trying to make small mindful choices in my daily life recycling especially is something i do with real care and intention this earth crochet project actually began as a simple educational prop for my child s daycare but over time it quietly grew into something more a small campaign carrying my sincere hopes for the environment though tiny in size i m sharing this pattern with the heartfelt wish that it becomes a gentle act of love for our planet this pattern creates a small 3d earth motif perfect as a soft toy keychain or educational prop it is worked in the round using single_crochet and basic increase/decrease stitches yarn romeo korean yarn fiber content 60% cotton 40% premium acrylic yardage 50g / 120m approx 131 yards one ball of the blue yarn main color makes approximately 5 earths each motif uses around 25 30 yards of blue and a small amount of green for the continents the green yarn is used slightly less than the blue hook size 3 5 mm e
