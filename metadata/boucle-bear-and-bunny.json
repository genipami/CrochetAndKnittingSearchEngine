  "notes": "crochet your own **adorable classic teddy bear and bunny** using special boucle yarn! these sweet stuffies are so soft and cuddly and will make perfect gifts for you and your loved ones! you will need less than 1 skein of baby soft boucle yarn to crochet each stuffed animal (70 g of \"tan\" for bear and 80 g of \"peach\" for bunny). this special boucle yarn blurs the stitches and gives an amazing finished look as people will hardly believe that they are crocheted! \r\n\r\nplease note that this pattern is not recommended for complete beginners as some crochet, amigurumi and working in the round experience would be beneficial (you cannot see individual stitches when working with this yarn, so you will need to feel for the next stitch). tips for working with boucle/fuzzy yarn are included in the pattern, and the skill level would be a level 3 intermediate.\r\n\r\nthe free pattern can be found **[here][1]** and the step-by-step tutorial can be found [**here**][2].  the printable pdf for purchase is a total of 11 pages including the cover page, step-by-step photos and tutorial, and face shaping graphics. special bonus patterns include the christmas hat for the bear and christmas headband for the bunny (note that the pink skirt as seen in the pictures is from one of our daughter's dolls - no pattern is included for the skirt). \r\n\r\nwe hope you enjoy crocheting your own sweet bunnies and bears! you can use the hashtags **#bouclebear** and **#bouclebunny** when posting your wip and final photos on social media so we can all follow along!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.allaboutami.com/pattern-boucle-bear-bunny/\r\n  [2]: https://www.allaboutami.com/boucle-bear-bunny/"
