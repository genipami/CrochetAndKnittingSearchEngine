    "content": "from inside the body to the outside so the ball yarn tail can be later worked into some inside stitches and hidden in the body i pulled through about an arms length of yarn any more would be too unwieldy i was able to just finish all the stitches with a very small amount left you can either add more yarn part way through or if you are very close like me you can use the old trick that when you are hiding your tail under a few stitches inside the body you can insert the needle and then thread the yarn through the needle this requires way less yarn you will embroider using a back stitch meaning you will go forwards by going backwards here is a youtube on how to make this stitch https //www youtube com/watch v=zqsmzxpfnbg&t=66s make these lines three row apart see image start with the round with the first two-color increase at the bottom of the body hide your starting tail and ending tail in the body when working be careful that you do not tangle or catch any of your tails in the body pokeball to dragonite reversible pattern by the nerd gremlin use this same method to add lines to the tail starting from the base of the tail and working to the tip see image you can add these after you finish the tail and work all the backstitches from the outside thread your tapestry needle through a random part of the tail up through your starting point then when you are done you can hide that tail in the pokemon tail see image for how to work these stitches from the outside only image from https //penguinandfish com/blogs/embroidery-stitches/how-to-do-a-backstitch-by-hand there are several pieces you will make and attach to the body i recommend crocheting them all then attaching them together i put sewing instructions for each piece just after each one though often i say hide the tails in the body you can further secure these by working the tails under some stitches inside the body or if you have two tails you can tie pokeball to dragonite reversible pattern by the nerd gremlin them together sometimes you cannot do either of these such as when sewing the eyes to the head i found it sufficient to just leave long tails hiding in the head the only pieces missing in this image are the two yellow wings i decided to add those after i took the image head use yellow yarn round 1 6 single_crochet magic_ring with 6 single_crochet round 2 increase x 6 12 round 3 single_crochet increase x 6 18 round 4-11 18 single_crochet leave a long tail to sew this part to the body when you attach it do your best to line up the end of the head and the start of the back legs only stitches in the body/neck use your tapestry needle and the long tail from the head and sew together the front legs"
