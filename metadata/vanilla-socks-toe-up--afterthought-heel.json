  "notes": "a vanilla recipe for toe up socks with an afterthought heel, so you ask, what makes this one different?\r\n\r\nno cutting of threads, \r\nadditional rows on heel  \r\nadditional stitches in the arch suited for high arched feet.\r\n\r\n<small>a special mention about this colourway: the yarn used in the photo was a special colourway, called \"box of chocolates\", which i dyed to celebrate my 40th birthday. there are 40 colours, that are each separated with a thin stripe of chocolate brown. each of the 40 colours is connected to a colour memory for every year of my life. i have very distinct memories from age 3 onwards and almost all of my childhood memories are connected to colours, iridescence and luminosity.  the colours from my first 3 years are my moms memories. it was wonderful to plan this colourway with her input.</small>\r\n\r\n<small>the 40 balls of \"box of chocolates\" were not sold. i offered them in my random club - but with a catch. the \"purchaser\" paid only the postage but did not get the yarn. they then gifted the yarn to another raveler, and it was posted with a personal letter to the person who was nominated to receive the yarn.  this experience left me filled with love and deep appreciation for the ravelry community. </small>\r\n\r\nso in the spirit of this, it is wonderful to give you this pattern.\r\n\r\nif you have any questions then pop me a pm and i will help you.\r\n\r\nhappy knitting!\r\ncarle'\r\n\r\n "
