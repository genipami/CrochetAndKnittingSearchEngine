  "notes": "i loved this stitch pattern. sprinkling puffs between simple double crochet stitches let me achieve exactly the look i was going for. as. i was working, i couldn’t decide if the puff stitches looked more like hearts or leaves climbing up the blanket. i love that the puff stitches look the same on either side of the blanket – yay for no wrong side!\r\n\r\nwhile i decided to crochet a baby blanket with this free pattern, i’ve also included ten other sizes ranging from lovey to king in case you want to make a larger project. there’s a chart letting you know all the details for each size, plus i’ll include information so you can make this crochet project any size you want. \r\n\r\ni used a worsted weight, variegated yarn for my crochet baby blanket; but i think using a pretty solid or heathered yarn would be just as beautiful. it is possible to use a bulky weight yarn for this blanket, but just remember it will change the finished size of your final product. \r\n\r\n* i used 1200 yd (almost 3 skeins) of hobbii cascata in the shade angel (01). \r\n* for the border, i used hobbii amigo xl in the shade white."
