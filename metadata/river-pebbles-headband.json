  "notes": "the river pebbles headband features the 2×1 broken rib stitch, that is only a 2-row repeat. the headband is knitted flat.\r\n\r\nthe first and last 3 stitches form an i-cord edging, that makes the edges look neat and prevents them from curling.\r\n\r\nthe the cast-on and bind-off edges are seamed together forming a decorative twist in the middle. the seam is hidden by the twist and is not visible."
