    "content": "okay the rules of the game are that every day of march 2008 you will receive two game instructions 1 a particular stitch to do 2 a change in medium hook yarn or direction the number of the given stitch to do will be chosen using a given random number generator if you do not have access to the given generator please ask a friend for a random number in the given range and do that many of the stitch where a given stitch/pattern name has variations you should do the variation of your choice so double_crochet may be done by either uk or us versions a shell or fan may have different numbers of stitches within it the variation chosen should be consistent on that day i am assuming everyone has access to at least two hooks and two yarns if a given instruction won t work for you eg i say to go up a hook size and you re already using your largest please use your discretion this is only meant to take a few minutes each day and should not be detrimental to your other projects i hope it s fun daily discussions of how the project is going are here http //www ravelry com/discuss/party-crochet-month-on-ravelry/118694/"
