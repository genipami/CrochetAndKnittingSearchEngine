  "notes": "this is my first ever knitting pattern and im so excited to share it with you!\r\n\r\nas a lover of fungi and a believer of all things magick, i knew i wanted to create socks that encompass the mystical nature of the woods along with warm autumn tones. since a young child, i have always been captivated by fairy rings, albeit a little wary… ‘just in case!’. a fairy ring is a circle of mushrooms that are shrouded in folklore and legend. many believe they are a place where the fae folk congregate to play and dance. legends warn against humans entering the ring joining the dance, but these socks are completely safe to dance around in; and perhaps they will even add a touch of fae energy and mischief to your every step!   \r\nif you make these socks, i’d love to see them! tag me on instagram @underthewillowknits\r\n\r\nthis pattern is knitted from the cuff down using the magic loop method on circular needles. i have used size 2.5mm to achieve an adult size m, although different needle sizes can be used to achieve your desired sized socks (e.g. 2.25mm for a smaller size, 2.75mm for larger).\r\nthe pattern includes a basic slip stitch heel, but feel free to use whichever heel is your favourite!\r\n\r\ni used 'vesemir' sock set (100g main colour skein, 20g mini contrast) by the fibre fox, along with 'haar' by nervus fibre. \r\ni only have size 3 feet so didn't use the full 100g main colour, but amount needed will depend on the desired sock length.",
