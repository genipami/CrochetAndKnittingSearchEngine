  "notes": "knitting and crochet have a stereotype associated with them that they are for 'grandmas.' which is fine, grandmas are amazing, but i think we should be able to enjoy the hobbies we love regardless of age. when someone asks you where you got this top (which they will) you can tell them that you made it and its actually crocheted in granny stitch!\r\n\r\nthis pattern is worked seamlessly from the top, down. you will begin at the neckline, increase in a raglan style to shape your sleeves and body, and then separate. your body will be finished first, followed by each sleeve. this top is shown using 5 colors and switching after each row in the same order throughout the sweater. you may use more or less colors depending on your preference.\r\n\r\n\r\n[a free version of this pattern can be viewed on my blog.][2]\r\n\r\nthis pattern is designed in 9 sizes:\r\nxs, (s, m, l, xl), (2x, 3x, 4x, 5x)\r\nbust/chest circumference: 32.5, (36, 39.5, 44.5, 48), (51.5, 56.5, 60, 63.5)”\r\n\r\nthis top is designed to be worn with 0-4” of positive ease. model is 6’ tall, has a 33” bust, and is wearing a size small with 3” of positive ease. for best fit, choose a size that is 0-4” larger than your corresponding bust measurement. for example, if your bust is 45”, you would wear a size xl.\r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\n350, (375, 425, 475, 500), (550, 600, 650, 700) grams / 815, (870, 985, 1100, 1160), (1275, 1395, 1510, 1625) yards lion brand coboo yarn; 1, (1, 1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2, 2) balls in each color taupe, tan, mauve, pale pink, and white.\r\nsize g-6 (4.0 mm) crochet hook\r\ntapestry needle to weave in ends\r\nnote on yarn: to make this more cost effective, you can use more colors for the higher sizes and use more full balls. for example, with size 5x you may choose to use 7 colors, each in a 100g ball of yarn\r\nnote:  all yarn weights are approximate.  you may use more or less depending on your tension and crochet style.  \r\n\r\n14 stitches and 11 rows = 4” in granny stitch using size 4.0 mm crochet hook\r\n\r\nthis is an intermediate level crochet pattern.\r\n\r\nthis pattern is written in us english terms.\r\n\r\nthis pattern and photographs of this garment are property of kaitlin barthold of originally lovely. this pattern and design are subject to copyright and are for personal use only. all commercial use is strictly prohibited. you may not produce or distribute this pattern under any circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [2]: https://www.originallylovely.com/crochet/maria-top-crochet-pattern/"
