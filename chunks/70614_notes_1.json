    "content": "i don t know what this stitch is called but it uses two contrasting yarns which alternate on each row you end up with a fairly bulky fabric with a different color on each side depending on the size of the hook and yarn weight you can end up with a heavy dense fabric to keep even the coldest day at bay or a lighter relatively anyway fabric this can be used for any project that needs to be thick such as potholders trivets afghans baby blankets and even bedspreads"
