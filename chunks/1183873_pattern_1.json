    "content": "giant tardigrade water bear crochet pattern by andro meda on ravelry materials & methods yarn 1 full skein 200-220 yds of super bulky #6 weight bernat blanket or baby blanket yarn if you want the mouth and claws to be in a different color as i did you will also need scraps probably less than 8-10 yds of a secondary color of the same yarn hook 8 0 mm or whatever size you need to get a nice tight gauge suitable for amigurumi other materials needed - tapestry needle must be big enough to use with super bulky yarn - 2 safety eyes i used 12 mm size alternately eyes can be made with buttons felt etc o yes as i was surprised to learn most tardigrade species have eyes - scissors - polyester stuffing - stitch markers or safety pins yarn scraps\u2026 anything to mark stitches gauge & size this is amigurumi so exact gauge does not matter as long as it s tight my tardigrades were roughly 16-18 inches 40-45 cm long from end to end stitches used - magic_ring - working in front or back loop only - chain chain - slip_stitch slip_stitch - single_crochet single_crochet - increase increase a k a 2 single_crochet in one stitch - decrease decrease a k a single_crochet 2 together i like to use the invisible decrease method but regular decreases work too - half-double_crochet half_double_crochet construction the tardigrade is worked top-down starting with the mouth the 8 legs are made separately and seamed on the details claws and mouth in the secondary color are done last working in the round you will be working in the round but not in a spiral instead it is made by joining in the round starting in the same st as the slip_stitch join that means that every round starts with chain 1 and ends with a slip_stitch into the 1st stitch of the round if you re not sure what that means here is a detailed description this is the 2nd method described on that page joining in the round starting in the same stitch as the slip_stitch join the chain 1 at the start of each round and slip_stitch at the end do not count toward the stitch count for that round when crocheting the next round no stitches will be worked in the previous round s slip_stitch join if you make the slip stitches tight the bulky yarn hides the join fairly well as long as you keep it on the tardigrade s underside i used woven-in tails to hide it further if you re concerned about it this invisible slip_stitch join method would probably work but i haven t personally tried it with this pattern to confirm instructions we ll start with the head working in the main color r1 single_crochet 9 in a magic_ring and pull it tight slip_stitch to join to the 1st single_crochet *place a stitch marker in the back loop of the 1st single_crochet of this"
