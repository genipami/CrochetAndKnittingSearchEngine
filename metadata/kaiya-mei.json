  "notes": ">**sign up for the [knitosophy newsletter][1] for the best deals and to stay informed about what i’m working on!\r\n\r\ni designed this pattern for a special baby girl named kaiya mei. this fair isle motif is intended to fade gradually and randomly from the first color to the second. i chose a multi-color yarn with a natural main color to soften the look, but i think two solid and contrasting colors would work great, too. get creative!\r\n\r\nthis pattern includes a chart. however, given the random nature of the motif it is a forgiving pattern, so color mistakes are no biggie!\r\n\r\nkaiya mei has just received an update with a major face lift! the pattern and chart now accommodates the following sizes:\r\n\r\nnewborn (6-12 months, toddler, small child, child, tween, medium adult, large adult)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://sibforms.com/serve/muifaik7rs6y_yedppepehhixtlq0y_redicgnex8__tlnhkbn52b5uhj_rzkhpifu0eyaw7svy-ol11agc0-rppfsp_ogxyccuf6fvkhw5sib5kkyi67kr60jhegfc81vccjx4b6v8tb8zkyhlra2vvzxqhxijq0kbmtrubsajewp27vlak3qlebkfo35nrtohjrzk84o3tecva",
