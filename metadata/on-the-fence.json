  "notes": "there are many things i’m on the fence about: contrasting cuffs, heels and toes on a socks, for example. they always tend to look scrappy, as if you ran out of yarn to do a complete pair of socks. but with just a tiny but of colourwork for the transition, it really looks beautiful, don’t you agree? these almost vanilla socks work up very quickly, but add that tiny bit of interest to keep you motivated and make it all look coherent and intentional.\r\n\r\ngauge\r\n40 stitches/10cm in stranded colourwork on larger needles\r\n36 stitches/10cm in stockinette on smaller needles\r\n\r\nmaterials\r\n• approx. 50g–60g of mc yarn (grey)\r\n• approx. 30g of cc yarn (red)\r\n• 2.5mm dpns or needles for magic loop or size required to get gauge\r\n• 2mm dpns or needles for magic loop or size required to get gauge\r\n• tapestry needle\r\nthe pattern is written for knitting on a set of five dpns, but can easily be adjusted to your favourite style of knitting socks.\r\n\r\nsizes\r\nsizes s (m, l, xl) with a stitch count of 56 (64, 72, 80) in the stockinette part. the foot circumference at the suggested gauge is 15,5cm (17,75cm, 20cm, 22,25cm). length can easily adjusted in the stockinette part.\r\n",
