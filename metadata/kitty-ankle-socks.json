  "notes": "these are two-toned, toe-up ankle socks with a kitty chart on the toe and foot. they feature a simple short-row heel. they can be made with contrasting colors or two-of-a-kind. this is my first foray into design and i had a lot of fun. feel free to contact me with any issues!\r\n\r\n\r\n01/01/2017 edit: \r\ni am so honored and humbled by the positive response to this pattern!\r\n*i wanted to address the questions i have received regarding how the chart should be executed - for my version, i knit the chart intarsia style, but it can also be duplicate stitched, or a mixture of the two (eyes duplicated, ears and nose intarsia), it's totally up to you!* \r\n",
