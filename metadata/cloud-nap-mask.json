  "notes": "the **cloud nap mask** was designed somewhere above the clouds. \r\n\r\nit began as an improvised in-flight project when the sunlight streaming through the window made sleep impossible. with only a skein of sock yarn on hand, this quick little pattern was born midair.\r\n\r\nthe mask is worked in the round to create a double-layered fabric for extra softness and comfort. shaping is achieved with symmetrical increases and decreases across both layers. the front and back are then joined using the kitchener stitch, and the look is completed with an i-cord band that fits comfortably around the head. \r\n\r\nit’s a fast, relaxing knit — perfect for travel, using up leftover sock yarn, or making a thoughtful handmade gift.\r\n\r\n**size**\t\r\none size\r\n\r\n**finished dimensions**\t\r\nwidth – 17 cm, height – 10 cm\r\n\r\n**gauge**\t\r\n32 sts × 40 rows = 10 × 10 cm (4 × 4 in) in stockinette stitch, worked on 2.5 mm (us 1½) needles after washing and blocking\r\n\r\n**needles**\t\r\n2.5 mm (us 1½) circular needles, 60–80 cm long, if using the magic loop method, or a set of five 2.5 mm (us 1½) double-pointed needles, 15 or 20 cm long\r\n\r\n**yarn**\t\r\napprox. 15–20 g of fingering-weight sock yarn (≈ 50 g / 200 m). \r\n\r\n**suggested yarns**\r\nfilcolana arwetta (50 g / 210 m) or lamana merida (50 g / 200 m)\r\n",
