    "content": "this is a very fast crochet project modeled after the calorimetry 1 designed by kathryn schoendorf in the winter 2006 issue of knitty for those of us who don t knit or - *gasp* - like crochet better but who love the look of the calorimetry this gives an alternative crochet version more patterns will be created soon that are similar to this headband style but will vary with the type of stitch and with the width of the actual hat to give several variations on this classic pattern several of my amazing testers tried out the pattern in different types of fiber and the best draping occurred with cotton and superwash wool acrylic fibers were still beautiful but draped differently than cotton and wool fibers thanks for peeking at the pattern and let me know if you have any questions or comments thanks 1 http //www ravelry com/patterns/library/calorimetry"
