    "content": "adjusting size/working in different yarn weights if you wish to make a larger or smaller hat simply add or subtract row from the ribbing in multiples of 6 or 12 you will also have to adjust the number of main body row if you would like to use a different weight of yarn then you will likely need to adjust your hook sizes to maintain the hat s slouchiness for example if you wish to use worsted yarn you may want to use a size 5 5mm hook for the ribbing and a 6mm hook for the main body and decreases since you ll be working at a larger gauge you ll need to work fewer ribbing row as long as you work your ribbing in multiples of 6 or 12 it will work"
