  "notes": "a totoro plushie pattern where you crochet the body, arms, ears, and tail (and tummy and scleras) and then sew the pieces together. \r\n\r\ni'd been looking online for this style of plushie for awhile and couldn't find one that wasn't wildly incorrect (that wasn't taken down) so ended up making it through trial and error and wrote the pattern down once it was done. i'm offering it for free here, but if you'd like to donate a tip as a thanks, i accept tips through ko-fi.\r\n\r\ntip via ko-fi: [https://ko-fi.com/thispapercloudcrochet][1]\r\n\r\nmy photo uses a wool/acrylic blended yarn of worsted weight with a 6mm hook. the pattern used up an entire 200yd skein of light grey. feel free to change up the yarn and hook sizes. this will just affect the size of the final product.\r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\nyarn - light grey\r\nyarn - white\r\nyarn - dark grey or black\r\n6mm hook\r\nyarn needle\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://ko-fi.com/thispapercloudcrochet",
