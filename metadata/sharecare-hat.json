  "notes": "let share and care! \r\n\r\n***this design has been inspired by caring and sharing. share the hat with your partner, brother, sister or parents.** sharecare hat is perfect for your family’s next eye-catching adventure, as it is as enjoyable to knit as it is to wear. it’s the perfect unisex hat, knitted in gorgeous brioche stitch which makes it fully reversible. once you get into the rythm of it, brioche stitch is no more difficult than basic ribbing. you get to try out a new stitch pattern, and end up with a cute design.\r\n\r\nsimple and easy to knit, the sharecare hat can be made with or without a brim, just using any contrasting dk weight yarns. there are two different versions of the hat – which one will you make?*\r\n\r\nthis hat is worked in the round from the bottom up, starting with the brim (or not – the pattern has notes for version 2 without the brim), continuing with the body part and the crown is shaped by decreases, which is finished on double pointed needles. two-color brioche is unique and the result is like two different hats  - you can wear both sides. it creates a gorgeous reversible fabric. this beanie is an average adult size version - if you want a shorter or bigger size – do more or fewer sections, more pattern rounds up or use larger needles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyarn: \r\nyarn: drops lima (65% wool, 35% alpaca, 50gr / 1.76oz – 100m / 109yd).\r\nmc yarn – light beige mix (206); cc yarn – green  (705).  or use any other dk weight yarn. \r\n\r\nyarn consumption: 55gr / 2oz of each color, mc and cc. my beanie weighs exactly 110 gr / 4oz (including pom pom)\r\n\r\nneedles: 40cm (16\") circular needle or dpns (double pointed needles) in 3.00 mm (us 2 ½) for the ribbing and 3.50mm (us 4) for the pattern. \r\n\r\nskill level: this pattern is ideal for an adventurous beginner.\r\n\r\nfinished size: average adult size (patterned beanie in the picture):\r\ndepth – 25 cm (10“) \r\ncirc – 44 cm (17.5“) fits head approx. 57 to 60 cm (22.5 – 24“) \r\n*measurements taken unblocked. fits head approx. 57cm (22.5“). hats shown have a 57cm / 22.5” head circumference. measurements taken unblocked.* \r\n\r\nother tools: tapestry needle; scissors; round counter (if needed); stitch marker (if needed) for marking the beginning of the round.\r\n\r\ngauge: 22 sts x 26 rows = 10cm (4“) in two-color brioche stitch (using 3.00 mm (us 2 ½  ) needles.\r\n*needle sizes are recommendations only. always use needle size necessary to achieve given gauge (to save your time).\r\nmy personal knitting tension is tight. if yours isn’t, consider using perhaps 2.50mm (us 1 ½ ) for ribbing and 3.00mm (us 2 ½ ) needles for body.*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**and thank you again my dear test knitters. without you, my testing guys, this pattern isn’t here ….**\r\n\r\nand tech edited by [tabatha thomas studio][1]\r\n\r\nyou find me: [instagram][2]\r\nravelry: [raina kruus pattern support][3] \r\nfacebook : [facebook][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.tabathathomas.co.uk/\r\n  [2]: https://www.instagram.com/happyknittingsheep/\r\n  [3]: https://www.ravelry.com/groups/raina-kruus-pattern-support\r\n  [4]: https://www.facebook.com/happy-sheep-533810903302846/?ref=settings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
