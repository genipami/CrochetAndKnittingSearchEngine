    "content": "the milos shawl is definitely a summer shawl named after the greek island of milos mostly because of the colorway i used for this project it s a fairly easy crochet shawl pattern as you will keep repeating the same stitches throughout the project this makes it ideal for beginners or people who want to practice with their gauge issues the milos shawl is also what we call a one skein shawl meaning you will have to buy only one ball of yarn to complete it the pattern is designed to easily stop when you run out of yarn you just start from one tip and the shawl just keeps growing every couple of row"
