  "notes": "the irish adventure bag was designed for our trip to ireland - and it's an exploration of cables and seamless construction!\n  \nthe irish adventure bag features three different cable patterns, each unique. but there is still a rhythm to it. bobbles frame the stitching throughout, and the wrong side rows offer a little break from the post-stitch action on the other side.\n  \none of the things i'm proudest of is the technique i used to make this bag seamless - even though it's all worked in rows, not in the round! on top of that, we only have to break the yarn once during crocheting! with only 3 skeins used, you could make this whole bag and only have 6-8 ends to weave in.\n  \nthis pattern is free on the blog, or you can purchase the ad-free pdf here!"
