  "notes": "a crochet version of my lucky duckling pattern!\r\n\r\nthere are two pdfs - one us version crochet and the other uk\r\n\r\ni use basic single (double uk) crochet and i've added quite a few directional instructions so this could be deemed as 'beginner friendly'\r\n\r\ni've added links to the yarn i used although you can use whatever you like/ can get your hands on to be honest.\r\n\r\ni've also added links to the eyes i used and indeed links to the yarn should you wish to make yours similar.\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy creating  this little crochet fellow!\r\n\r\nclaire\r\nxx"
