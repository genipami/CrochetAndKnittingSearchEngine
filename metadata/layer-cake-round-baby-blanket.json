  "notes": "this pretty round blanket comes in 12 versatile sizes would make a beautiful addition to the nursery, your little girl's bedroom, or even your own! there's lots of texture, and the stitches in each round are different which makes for a fun and interesting project.\r\n\r\n*this crochet pattern is available for free (lovey-large throw sizes) on my website or you can download all 12 sizes here as a print-optimized, ad-free pdf for your convenience.*\r\n\r\n**difficulty:**\r\neasy intermediate\r\n*techniques used: working in the 3rd loop of a half-double crochet, cluster stitches, post stitches, shells*\r\n\r\n**materials needed:**\r\n455 (1140, 1395, 1975, 2300, 3040, 3860, 5820, 6960, 8200, 9530) yards #4 worsted weight caron jumbo ombre in \"sepia\" or color of your choice (red heart with love, and caron one pound are all good ones to substitute with, if you like) \r\n(if hacking your yarn like i did you may wish to buy 1/3 more yarn than you will actually need)\r\n6.5mm (j) hook, or hook needed to obtain gauge\r\nyarn needle\r\nscissors\r\nstitch markers \r\nyarn winder (for hacking yarn)\r\n\r\n**stitches used:**\r\nch = chain\r\nsl st = slip stitch\r\nsc = single crochet\r\nhdc = half double crochet\r\ndc = double crochet\r\nbpsc = back post single crochet\r\nbphdc = back post half double crochet\r\n\r\n**additional terms:**\r\n*working in the 3rd loop of an hdc:* look at the top of the stitch, and locate the sideways “v”, bend the stitch to look at the back, and you should see another “v” made by the “yarn over”. you’ll be working into the back loop of that “v”, this is the yarn over and is called the 3rd loop.\r\n*3dc cluster:* yo, insert hook into stitch, pull up a loop, yo, draw through 2 loops (1st stitch of cluster made), yo, insert hook into same st, pull up a loop, yo draw through 2 loops (2nd st of cluster made), yo, insert hook into same st, pull up a loop, yo draw through 2 loops (3rd st of cluster made), yo, draw through all loops on hook.\r\nst/sts = stitch/stitches\r\nsp/sps = space/spaces\r\nsk = skip\r\nprev = previous\r\n\r\n**gauge:**\r\ncircle should measure 8\" across after round 9.\r\n\r\n**measurements:**\r\n*approximate diameter before blanket edging is added. blanket edging adds 2 additional inches to total diameter.*\r\nlovey: 22\"\r\nbaby blanket: 36\"\r\nreceiving blanket: 40\"\r\ntoddler blanket: 48\"\r\ncrib blanket: 52\"\r\nsmall throw blanket: 60\"\r\nlarge throw blanket: 68\"\r\npdf includes twin-california king sizes\r\n\r\n**additional notes:**\r\n-ch 1 at beginning of round does not count as a stitch.\r\n-while i have used an ombre yarn to create this blanket, i never recommend using shorter striping variegated yarns because they will hide the pretty textures\r\n*stitch markers are going to save you so much time and headache in this pattern, especially in the rounds that have alternating increases.* use them liberally. your sanity will thank you later.\r\n-having trouble getting your counts right? have you remembered stitch markers?\r\n-twin, double, queen, king sizes and california king sizes are included in the paid pdf pattern.\r\n-to get your blanket looking like mine you will need to do some yarn hacking. i used the equivalent yardage of 3 skeins of yarn for the blanket in the picture, but i ended up using parts of a 4th skein to get my colors to fade the way i wanted. use the remaining yarn to crochet the matching [cake shop cushions to complete the set!][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/cake-shoppe-cushions"
