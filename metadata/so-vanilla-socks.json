  "notes": "this is the first of four patterns in my so vanilla socks series.\r\n\r\ni’ve been knitting socks since i started knitting in 2007. since then i’ve knit over 300 pairs of socks and i almost always go back to this specific recipe. i’ve knit socks both toe-up and cuff-down, but i’ve found to prefer toe-up. toe-up sock knitting makes it easy to try on your socks at every stage of your knitting, and you can knit to your preferred leg length or until you run out of yarn. \r\nin this version, i’m going to teach you the recipe that i use when i knit toe-up socks using magic loop. \r\n\r\n**note:** i do use the fish lips kiss heel and i highly recommend that for the heel, but i have included a short row heel in the instructions.\r\n\r\n**what you’ll need:** \r\n2.25mm (us 1) circular knitting needles (or size needed to get gauge), i recommend at least 32 inch (my preferred length). you can substitute dpns and i’ll show you how in the pattern notes.\r\n100 grams of fingering weight sock yarn. \r\nstitch marker or locking stitch marker (optional).\r\nruler or measuring tape\r\ndarning needle. \r\n\r\n**gauge:**\r\n8.5 stitches/inch using 2.25mm needles.\r\n\r\n**sizing:** \r\n1 (2, 3) - which fits around a foot circumference of 7 (8, 9) inches around. \r\n\r\n**important notes:**\r\nthis pattern is written for magic loop, but can easily be changed to dpns. use 2 needles for n1, and another 2 for n2.
