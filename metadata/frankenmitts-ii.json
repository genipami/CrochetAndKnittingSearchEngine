  "notes": "are you ready for another wild and wacky fingerless gloves fanatics mystery knit and crochet? back in october 2021, the moderators of the fgf group hosted a mystery kal, to rave reviews. now we’re back with another design just in time for your halloween 2025 celebrations. our unusual approach to design for this mitt is the same as the previous edition. four of our moderators each undertook to design a section of the mitt which we designed blind without knowing what the others were cooking up in their cauldron.  once we had drafted our portion (potion?), we exchanged instructions and honed the clues through rigorous testing. the final results are ready for you to enjoy. we are pleased to say that this time, it will be a kcal, as we have incorporated both knit and crochet into the design. as previously, we can’t guarantee simple, classic elegance, but our design has a certain je ne sais quoi. it’s a frankenmitt! need we say more? \r\n\r\nclue release dates:\r\noctober 1\r\noctober 8\r\noctober 15\r\noctober 22\r\noctober 26\r\n\r\nfor a more cohesive look, you may choose to work your little frankies in all one yarn (ho-hum). if you are more adventurous, or just like to change things up, try digging through your scrap bin and changing yarns with every clue - coordinate colours or clash them violently according to your tastes.\r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\nas with the previous frankenmystery, it’s difficult to say exactly how much yarn you’ll need. 160 - 180 meters should be a generous estimate. there are points where you have options which might impact how much yarn you’ll use. we used both fingering weight yarn and lace weight yarn in the design. lace weight is recommended for one of the clues. however, you could get away with working the whole mitt in fingering weight if you have no lace weight.\r\n\r\nbeads! once again, beads are suggested for some of the clues. and once again, as this is a frankenmitt, you are welcome to sprinkle some beads in your other clues. your frankenmitt, your decision! if beads terrify you, you are free to omit any beading. there are options, as noted above…\r\n\r\nother tools:\r\n•tapestry needle for finishing\r\n•crochet hook or dental floss for beading (or whatever you use for adding beads)\r\n•beads (optional) - the number of beads will vary with your choices, and with the clue. clues that offer beads will provide further information as to number. remember that you don’t have to be matchy-matchy with the beads…\r\n•scrap yarn for holding stitches\r\n•stitch markers for marking beginning of round, and for clue 1 to track pattern repeats\r\n•needles recommended from 2.25 mm right up to 3.75 mm. do you need each size between 2.25 - 3.75 mm? not necessarily, however, you should have at least two sets of needles that are at least 2 sizes apart from each other. if you have a range of needle sizes, you will likely find you’ll want to change needles for the different clues.\r\n•crochet hook in a size similar to the needles used for the fingering weight clues. perhaps 2.5 - 2.75 mm.\r\n\r\ngauge\r\n…is all over the map with this one. each clue has suggested needle sizes and one clue is worked at a very different gauge from the other clues. aim for a gauge that you have comfortably used for other fingerless mitts. warning: do not take the listed gauge above as the stated gauge. gauge varies with each clue. \r\n\r\nso buckle up! this will be a wild ride. be sure to join us over in the [fgf group][1] for the kcal. we’ll have tips, chatter and laughs as we try to make the craziest frankenmitts.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/discuss/fingerless-glove-fanatics/4376277/1-25"
