    "content": "**update** i have uploaded a newer better more complete version of the original pattern so i suggest you use that unless you ve already started with the first pattern **clarification** all the instructions are written for round-by-round not needle-by-needle so you can use dpns or magic loop as preferred this means that the gusset decreases are every second round not every round on every second needle **variations** for hiking socks the ribbing is pretty important so they don t fall down inside your boots some knitters find that *k2p2* is stretchier or just don t like the twisted rib you can totally use 2x2 ribbing for the cuff here i think it looks a bit funny next to the 3x1 unless you have good contrast between the colours"
