    "content": "all dice need a home why not make them one yourself this is a quick project perfect for using up bits of thread or lace yarn leftover from previous projects make the pattern as-is for a simple functional bag or use it as a base to experiment the optional fabric lining adds strength to the bag and only basic sewing skills are needed but if you don t want to break out the needle and thread it works perfectly well without the lining too this pattern comes in two sizes medium and large the medium bag comfortably holds one set of dice plus or minus a few pieces the large bag holds at least 5 sets of dice"
