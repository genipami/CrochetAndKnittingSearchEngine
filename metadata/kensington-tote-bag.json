  "notes": "tunisian crochet beginners rejoice! this casual tote bag works up quicker than you’d think. it’s made in just one piece using a large hook and super bulky wool-blend yarn. bring it along for trips to the farmers’ market or use it to securely hold your laptop when working on the go.\r\n\r\nthe “dipped” color-block look is one of my favorite techniques\r\nfor adding minimalist style without having to do complicated\r\ncolorwork. this tote is made using the tunisian knit stitch. it\r\nlooks just like knitting, but it has a sturdier build that will stand\r\nup to whatever you need to tote around.\r\n\r\nstitches and techniques\r\n• tunisian knit stitch\r\n• changing colors (stripes)\r\n• adding length in tunisian crochet\r\n• picking up stitches\r\n• mattress stitch seam\r\n\r\nyarn\r\nlion brand wool-ease® thick\r\n& quick (80% acrylic, 20% wool), category 6—super bulky weight, 106 yds (97 m)/170 g\r\n(6 oz). \r\n-(a) succulent, 85 yds (78 m), (1 skein)\r\n-(b) fisherman, 175 yds (160 m), (2 skeins)"
