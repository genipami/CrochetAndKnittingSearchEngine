    "content": "**sylvie scarf** pattern by missbriannajane this is my crochet take on the beloved knit sophie scarf i searched everywhere for something similar to crochet but i wanted it to drape well on the neck and to have a knit like crochet stitch i am so happy with how this turned out & was excited to share this is my first written pattern so please let me know if you have any questions **stitches** * linen stitch * modified i-cord border **materials** * 4mm crochet hook x2 * for the modified i-cord border you will need 2 crochet hooks of the same or smaller size without any grips on it if you don t plan on doing the border only one hook is needed * 50g of fingering weight yarn **quick notes before starting** * i use us crochet terminology * uses about 220yrds or 48g of fingering weight yarn body is ~40g and border is ~8g * i-cord modified border is optional but really finishes off the neckerchief well * took me ~7hrs for the scarf without the border and ~3hrs for the scarf with the border while watching tv"
