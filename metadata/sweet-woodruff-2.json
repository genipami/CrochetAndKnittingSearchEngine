  "notes": "a sweet mix of wavy eyelets and cables for a light spring pair of socks. i chose a lovely spring green colorway perfect for this time of year. the different greens bursting everywhere is so pretty right now.\r\n\r\nsweet woodruff is an easy to memorize pattern, lots of interest and texture. i can't recommend this sock yarn enough. filcolana arwetta is soft and yet hard wearing. its also easy on the wallet and great colors to choose from. you can easily make a shortie version with one skein! which would be great for summertime. \r\n\r\nthis sock is knit from the cuff down using the magic loop method. it is adaptable to other methods. lace and cable pattern is charted only but easy to read. i use a rounded toe for the pattern but that is optional of course. i like a cuff i can fold and that is what i did on the sample but of course that is optional too, a twisted ribbing would look equally nice. \r\n\r\nsize is adjustable, go up or down in needle size and if you have to increase your stitches add some purl stitches between the cables. \r\n\r\n",
