  "notes": "where we live, in northern alberta, canada we move ahead our clocks by 1 hour for daylights savings time.  it's known around the world as \"spring ahead\" and that's where the inspiration behind the name of our spring ahead beanie came from... and...who doesn't need another beanie?!!  \r\n\r\nthis is the perfect light hat for that time of year when the weather is just starting to warm up but it's still a bit chilly... spring!!\r\n\r\nyou will need approx. 180yds of dk yarn and size 4mm (us 6) for knitting in the round. (this hat is very simple to manipulate and adjust for using different weights of yarn and different sizes of needles)\r\n\r\nit's a super relaxing and easy pattern just using knits and purls, and with 3 sizes and the multiples given, you'll be able to knit one for everyone in the family!  \r\n\r\ncheck out our ravelry group, cozy up knits for fun knit alongs and pattern support.  we are also on you tube and instagram as cozyupknits!\r\n\r\nhappy knitting!\r\n\r\n ",
