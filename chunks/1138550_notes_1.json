    "content": "this is called the dad hat as i consider it a basic practical design nothing fancy but the ribbed design means it fits well to any head i have also been known to call this the burglar hat as it reminds me of the sort of fit of the hats the wet bandits wear in home alone it s completely adjustable add or remove stitches as you wish you ll just want them to be in multiples of 10 to keep the ribbing pattern i used basic natural yarns for this as they were destined for a cold environment with flammable materials so you don t want anything melty i used around 60-70g of yarn for each hat you may want up to 80g if making a larger size"
