  "notes": "the 0815 hat is a popular and classical design that has been around forever. the hat is worked in the round from the bottom up in a 1x1 ribbing design. through its foldable brim, the hat grows with the wearer and thanks to the ribbing, it is expandable and very flexible.\r\n\r\nhead circumference: 35-38 (39-45) 46-53 (54-56) 56-59 (59-62) cm\r\n\r\nlength: 19 (22) 26 (29) 32 (34) cm (washed and blocked)\r\n\r\nyarn: 50 (50) 100 (100) 100 (150) g\r\n\r\nsuggested yarn: schachenmayr alpaca classico (50g/90m) or sandnesgarn baby lama (50g/67m) if you opt for sandnesgarn, you’ll need an extra ball of yarn for size adult l.\r\n\r\nneedles: 4,5mm circular needles (40 cm string) and 4,5mm dpns or use magic loop technique. you can also use 5mm needles to achieve a looser/slouchier design.\r\n\r\nmaterials: 4 markers, tapestry needle.\r\n\r\ngauge: 23 sts x 26 rows = 10cm in 1x1 ribbing\r\n\r\ni’d be very happy to see your version of 0815 hat on instagram. please follow me @stadtkindknits and use the hashtag #0815hat\r\n\r\nplease, don’t hesitate to contact me via stadtkindknits@gmail.com for any questions. thank you and enjoy knitting!\r\n\r\nmarjorie"
