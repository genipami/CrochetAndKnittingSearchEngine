  "notes": "for pattern support please go to the questions thread [here][1].\r\n\r\n**...let me shout out a big thank you for your love, your ongoing support, your trust, your understanding, your patience....for being by my side on this journey.... hope you enjoy this little hat pattern!**\r\n\r\n\r\n*leni* is a casual hat, worked in the round from the folded brim to the top. combining one strand of mohair lace and one strand of fingering weight merino results in a soft and sumptuous look, but any other yarn that gives you the right gauge will work just fine. the hat is started with a provisional cast on and some ribbing which is then hidden when the main body of the hat is worked. a small delicate band of texture comes next and adds just the right amount of interest. an optional pompom is worked last.\r\n\r\nyarn suggestions\r\nfirst image:\r\nindependence street treat yo' self lite (450 yds (411 m)/ 100 g), shown in color weak mouse.\r\nlamana premia (328 yds (300 m)/ 25 g), shown in color #46 basalt blue.\r\nor\r\nsecond image:\r\nlolabean yarn co. navy bean (400 yds (366 m)/ 100 g), shown in color fountain grass.\r\nwalkcollection kidmohair lace (459 yds (420 m)/ 100 g), shown in color blush.\r\nor\r\nthird image:\r\nito rakuda (231 yds (211 m)/ 40 g), shown in color #649 mustard\r\nshibui tweed silk cloud (190 yds (174 m)/ 25 g), shown in color pollen\r\n\r\n**both yarns are used held together (yarns could be substituted for a single dk to worsted weight).**\r\n\r\nyou will need approximately \r\n200 (220, 238) yds [186 (201, 217) m] of each.\r\nnote: yardage includes optional pompom.\r\n\r\nneedles\r\nus 4 (3.5 mm) circular needle, 16\" (40 cm) long for brim.\r\nus 6 (4 mm) circular needle, 16\" (40 cm) long and dpns for body.\r\n\r\ngauge\r\n21 sts x 32 rows = 4\" (10 cm) square in stockinette stitch on larger needle after blocking.\r\n\r\nfinished measurements\r\ncircumference (unstretched): \r\n18 (19.5, 21)\" \r\n46 (49.5, 53.5) cm\r\nto fit \r\n20/21.5 (21.5/23, 23/24.5)\" \r\n51/54.5 (54.5/58.5, 58.5/62) cm\r\nheight (without pompom): \r\n8.5\" (21.5 cm)\r\n\r\nnotions\r\nsmooth waste yarn and crochet hook for provisional cast on, 8 stitch markers, row counter (optional), tapestry needle, pompom maker or a fake fur pompom (optional), blocking tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/discuss/designs-by-isabell-kraemer/topics/3988139"
