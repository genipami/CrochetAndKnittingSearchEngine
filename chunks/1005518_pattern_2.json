    "content": "until the sock is between 16 and 20cm from the cast on edge you can also add a simple stitch pattern which divides evenly into the number of sts for example a 4 6 or 8 st repeat for the medium size or a 4 6 9 or 12st repeat for the large this can be continued down the gusset decreases and on the instep to the toe if desired heel flap make sure that half the number - 32 36 st - are on one needle knit back and forth in row on these stitches to form the heel flap leaving the other stitches the instep or top of the foot sts on the wire of the circular needle row 1 *sl1 wyb k1 then repeat from * across 16 18 times in total row 2 sl1 wyf then purl remaining stitches repeat row 1 & 2 16 18 times until your flap is roughly square hint for men and for women with larger feet it is good to make the heel flap longer by a couple of repeats count the slipped st chains up the side or in the centre of the flap note this number down heel turn continue knitting back and forth on the heel flap stitches row 1 sl1 k18 20 ssk k1 turn work row 2 sl1 p7 7 p2tog p1 turn work row 3 sl1 knit to one st before the gap ssk k1 turn row 4 sl1 purl to one st before the gap p2tog p1 turn repeat row 3 & 4 until all sts have been knitted you will have 20 22 sts on your needle these are the heel stitches so note this number down in row 3 & 4 you are closing the gaps you knit or purl the last stitch before the gap together with the first stitch after it so no hole remains and all the stitches of the heel flap are gradually incorporated forming a rounded heel turn 3 gusset you are now going to knit in the round again knit across heel sts then pick up sts down the side of the heel flap one for each of the slipped stitch loops and one in the corner before the instep around 17 19 sts unless you increased the heel flap length move over to the 32 36 instep sts which you left on the wire and knit or pattern across them put a stitch marker on the needle then pick up sts on the other side of the heel flap one in the corner and one from every slipped stitch up the heel flap this should be the same number as on the other side but do not worry if there is a one or two stitch difference you will now be back at needle 1 with 20 22 heel sts + 17 19 1st flap sts on needle 1 and 32 36 instep sts + 17 19 2nd flap sts from the other flap"
