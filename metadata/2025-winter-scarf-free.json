  "notes": "the 2025 winter scarf is knit in the round from top to bottom (or bottom to top, it doesn’t really matter). the scarf is double lined so it’s extra cozy, but since it’s knit in the round all you have to know how to do is knit, no purling required for your new favorite scarf. can be knit with any worsted weight yarn, we used two balls each of knitting for olive’s heavy merino in ice blue and boudreaux.
