  "notes": "an easy stitch pattern for an asymmetric shawl using just one ball of cake yarn in a dk weight/light worsted weight.\r\nthe shawl is a boomerang shape that is perfect for wrapping around your shoulders, and makes a warm cosy scarf against winter winds.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is an easy make using basic stitches only. once you have the first few rows worked up, it is a simple 2-row repeat. you can adjust the pattern easily by making more or fewer rows, to make the size you want.\r\n\r\n**measurements**\r\nshawl measures 70 in [178cm] in longest length x 56 in [102cm] x 31 in [79cm] after blocking\r\n\r\na free version is available on my blog\r\n\r\n"
