    "content": "little mosaic squares are worked using the **overlay mosaic crochet ** technique** from centre-out** and were designed with beginners to this technique in mind each square uses only around 12m of each of two contrasting dk #3 weight colours making them perfect scrap-busters you can use any yarn you like just make sure that both colours are a similar weight and you use a hook appropriate to your yarn i recommend that you select two colours which contrast well at least to begin with so you can see the individual rounds easier however the design also looks pretty with less contrast or indeed in a single colour which brings out the texture of the stitches the small size just under 10cm makes these little squares ideal for **temperature blankets** too - you could use 1 colour for the daily high and the other for the low or maybe 1 colour for the temperature and the other for rainfall supporting **videos** are also available from my youtube channel right-handed https //youtu be/5dnmxjrzftu left-handed https //youtu be/f5fbiahg7ro for further support please consider joining my facebook group rosina crochets 1 1 https //www facebook com/groups/rosinacrochets"
