  "notes": "dumpling kitty is a cute pudgy kitty whose pattern is available for free! her body is crocheted with a flat base so she sits nicely wherever you place her, waiting patiently for treats. \r\n\r\n**finished size:** approximately 4\" tall when made with the indicated yarn and hook size, though your finished size may vary depending on your yarn brand and tension.\r\n**difficulty level:** easy - intermediate (previous experience and familiarity with amigurumi recommended)\r\n**time to finish:** approximately 3 hours\r\n\r\n**materials:**\r\n* approximately 42 yd of color a (body)\r\n* approximately 4 yd of color b (stripes)\r\n* polyester fiberfill\r\n* 9 mm safety eyes (2)\r\n* embroidery floss\r\n* regular needle and yarn needle\r\n\r\ni am happy to offer email support if you need any help while working through my patterns, or notice any errors! this pattern is for personal use only.\r\n\r\n**video tutorial:** [joining the ears!][1]\r\n\r\n**additional notes:** when making the stripes in this pattern, the instructions will tell you to \"change to color a or b\" depending on where you are. for example, if the pattern says:\r\n\r\n\"sc 36, change to color b, sc 5. (42)\"\r\n\r\nyou'll sc 36, [change your color][2] in the next stitch (37th stitch), then sc 5. you will end up with 37 sc of color a (because the stitch where you change colors still appears as color a) and 5 sc of color b. \r\n\r\nhopefully this clears things up for anyone who may have been having trouble with their stitch counts in certain rounds. if you're still having issues, feel free to email me!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://youtu.be/osvl5rtcfd8\r\n  [2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wamfssjojq"
