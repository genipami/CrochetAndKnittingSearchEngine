  "notes": "hygge burst hexie blanket pattern\r\n\r\n*****this pattern is available for free on my website at: https://www.nautikrallcrochet.com/blog-freepatterns/hyggebursthexieblanket\r\n\r\n(this listing is for those who wish to have an advertisement free pattern or printable copy).\r\n\r\nhygge (pronouced “hue-guh”) is a scandinavian word meaning everything that is cozy, happy, special, warm and nice. it’s used as a noun, a verb and an adjective! i fell in love with the idea of hygge after reading the little book of hygge: the danish way to live well by meik wiking. \r\n\r\nthe original hygge burst blanket pattern encompasses all the warmth, coziness and happiness that you can get from a blanket. i wanted the same feeling with this pattern—but brighter and fun for summer (hellloooooo neon tweed!!) rest assured, this won’t be the last colour combo i put together for this blanket. it was a blast to make and i absolutely cannot wait to put together a colour scheme using wool of the andes tweed for autumn :)\r\n\r\nfor now though, i hope you’re all loving the light-hearted colour combos of these hexagons :)\r\n\r\nthe pattern uses hobbii tweed delight (worsted weight) yarn and a 5mm hook.\r\npattern includes all colours used and the yarn quantities as well as exact positioning. my gift to you is taking the work out of colourwork! \r\n\r\nthe final blanket size was: approximately 48” x 59” inches.\r\n\r\npattern will include:\r\n- yarn amounts/quantities.\r\n- yarn colours.\r\n- stitch glossary.\r\n- printable pdf of blanket graph.\r\n- full colour chart of all hexagons and their positioning so you can make this exact colour copy!\r\n- full written instruction for the sunburst hexagon motif used.\r\n- written, photograph and video tutorial for border.\r\n- video tutorials for the sunburst hexagon as well as the continuous join as you go method.\r\n\r\nhappy crocheting everyone!\r\nl,\r\nm"
