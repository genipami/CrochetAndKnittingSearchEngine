    "content": "a quick and simple pattern to make a stylised **tiny daffodil** about 1 4cm diameter and 3cm tall including the stem i give mine to tiny knitted rabbits to hold but you could make a tiny bunch or use them to adorn spring projects the pattern only uses slip_stitch chain and magic_ring so is the same in both uk and us crochet terms each daffodil uses tiny amounts of yarn in yellow and green i recommend using a non-superwash 100% wool yarn and soaking your daffodils so that the yarn blooms to make a nice solid flower the flower is crocheted and i give instructions to either crochet a stem or knit an i-cord stem"
