  "notes": "this crochet hook roll is my nod to the beautiful ammonites and sparkly iron pyrite that grace the shores of the jurassic coast.\r\n\r\nif i am honest, i have never even thought about making a hook roll, but once i made this one, i fell in love!  i absolutely love the way it hugs my clover amour hooks (the colourful handles look so lovely set against the dark grey background).\r\n\r\ni wanted to find a way to make the 'pockets' horizontally instead of vertically, and i am so pleased with the way it turned out.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is available as a photo tutorial, with a supporting video tutorial by esther dijkstra from it's all in a nutshell.\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy the pattern.\r\n\r\ndedri"
