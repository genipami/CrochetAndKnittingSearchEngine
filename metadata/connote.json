things don‘t always go as planned, and too often, we become our own worst critics. we forget that yearlong (or longer!) commitments are hard. we fail to extend grace to ourselves in the same way we might extend it to others. let‘s try to break that bad habit together as we stitch through this project. the goal of this crochet-along is to bring you joy. it's an opportunity to learn new stitches, to play with unusual stripes, and to create something special, knowing that other crocheters around the world are right beside you, cheering you on. if you don‘t finish, that‘s okay! if you do finish, congratulations!\r\n\r\none of my favorite aspects of crochet-alongs is the camaraderie they engender. we celebrate when things go right; we commiserate when things go wrong; we remind each other that no matter how things go, we are in this together. we demonstrate kindness to one another—the same kindness each of us should give ourselves. \r\n\r\n* click [here][12] to watch a video about this month's clue.\r\n* the sample shawl used approximately 2545 m / 2781 yds in total: color a: 293 m / 320 yds, color b: 244 m / 267 yds, color c: 143 m / 156 yds, color d: 169 m / 185 yds, color e: 221 m / 242 yds, color f: 195 m / 213 yds, color g: 281 m / 307 yds, color h: 199 m / 217 yds, color i: 150 m / 164 yds, color j: 139 m / 152 yds, color k: 248 m / 271 yds, color l: 263 m / 287 yds. \r\n* gauge isn't crucial but can affect overall dimensions and yarn amounts.\r\n* **it is important that you save all your leftover yarn, as you will use previous colors as you work.**\r\n* \"current row\" refers to the row currently in progress. \"working row\" refers to the row you are working the current row into.\r\n* **very important: because this project uses high contrast colors, whether you use the suggested colors or other high contrast colors, spray or steam blocking your finished project is strongly encouraged to avoid colors bleeding during blocking.**\r\n\r\n*designed by janica york carter*\r\n\r\n***errata:***\r\n***7.29.25 - clue 7, row 111 updated.***\r\n\r\n***10.2.25 – clue 9, row 7 amended to say “the second to last fptr 4 rows below” to maintain the angle. row 9 updated to say, \"(fpdtr around next fptr 4 rows below current row)\" in the section with the pattern repeat.***\r\n\r\n***10.2.25 – clue 9, row 13 updated to say: with color i, ch 1, turn; sc in first 3 sc, fpdtr around first fpdtr 4 rows below current row, fpdtr around next fpdtr 4 rows below current row, sk next 2 sc on working row, *sc in next 2 sc, (fpdtr around next fpdtr 4 rows below current row) twice, sk next 2 sc on working row; rep from * across to last 4 sc, sc in next 2 sc, fpdtr around last fpdtr 4 rows below current row, sk next sc on working row, sc in last sc.
