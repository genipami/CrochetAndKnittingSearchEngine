  "notes": "brioche for beginners!  i thought we might benefit from a really basic brioche beanie pattern with lots of brioche, and a quick crown. the beanie is designed to be very tall, creating a deep fold-up brim to highlight the reversible brilliance of  brioche.  although the pattern is titled basic, this may be considered an intermediate level pattern because knowledge of stitch construction, and research about brioche is helpful.  \r\n\r\nphoto 1: size adult: mc: worsted merino superwash solids by plymouth yarn; 100% merino wool; 218 yards/ 100grams; color #7 soft gray       cc: painted sky by knitting fever; 100% superwash wool; 218 yards/ 3.52oz; color #205 wine violet  (this project used 210 yards/104grams of yarn)\r\n\r\nphoto 2: size child: mc: painted sky by knitting fever; 100% superwash wool; 218 yards/ 3.52oz; color #203 turquoise&purple     cc: painted sky by knitting fever; 100% superwash wool; 218 yards/ 3.52oz; color #205 wine violet  (this project used 180 yards/ 3.25oz of yarn)\r\n\r\nas a celebration of meeting the tax day challenge, this pattern is offered as knitting challenge to you! please, go to the blog post: http://marilynnsgardenknitdesign.blogspot.com/2015/04/brioche-basic-beanie-lets-bark-burp.html  you’ll find pattern details.  \r\nenjoy this pattern making many brioche basic beanies as gifts to family & friends. i’d love to see your finished projects. thank you, marilynn\r\n\r\nthe pattern pdf will print to 2 pages, you may want to print front & back.\r\n",
