    "content": "a simple idea to block drafts in your home this is called a crochet draft dodger or draft blocker i used caron cakes to crochet this i didn t want to overcomplicate the design as this will sit on the floor using two yarns together as talked about in the tutorial can hide the dust better than doing a solid colour i used caron cakes which i used the outside strand and interior strand of the same ball i used 1 full cake and a bit of a second one you could do two caron cakes if it s easier for you instead of the way i did it you can customize how long you want it to match your doors or window ledges"
