    "content": "one really fun thing about bbc s television series call the midwife is its wide array of gorgeous baby blankets it s impossible as a crocheter to not notice them one of them really caught my eye and after some trial-and-error i think i ve managed to replicate the pattern and i want to share it with you wouldn t this make the perfect gift for a new mommy who is a fan of the show the blanket is begun with a chain in multiples of 16 plus 6 to account for the spacing that occurs at the beginning of every row i created mine with a light weight super soft acrylic yarn and a size g hook however i think my pattern scaled out larger than the one in the photo if you really want to get it exact you ll probably need to use a fine weight yarn and a smaller hook it was already enough of a stretch for me to use a g hook to create an entire baby blanket so you won t see me attempting this with anything smaller it s a fun project one that will keep your brain engaged and when you re done you ll have your very own straight-from-1950s-london baby blanket well at least straight-from-the-set-of-a-1950s-london-tv-show have fun the original pattern appears in this vintage patons 9930 booklet 1 and two others using fingering weight yarn 1 http //www ravelry com/patterns/sources/patons-9930-heres-the-choice"
