  "notes": "this crochet rug is the perfect stash buster- it is made using 8 strands of worsted weight yarn held together, so adding scraps of yarn is easy to do. the rug can be made as big or as small as you would like- you could even make mini ones and use them as place mats!\r\n\r\n\r\nadding all sorts of colors makes for a very fun and colorful rug! there is no “wrong” color!",
