  "notes": "here's the german translation - [baby cardi kraus rechts gestrickt][1], courtesy of susanne.\r\n\r\nhere's the italian at [la maglia di marica][2]. thanks marica.\r\n\r\nhere's the spanish version thanks to mj in barcelona - [copper kettles and woolen mittens][3].\r\n\r\nit’s a  simple little cardi with super speedy top-down, seamless raglan construction and an optional i-cord button band.  my version was knit with less than 3 skeins of knit picks andean treasure sportweight alpaca on us 4 (3.5mm) needles at a gauge of 22sts = 4? in stockinette. it’s silly soft and a little fuzzy and toasty as can be. the finished measurements are 20? at the chest and 10? in length. so a 6-12 month sized baby? or older or younger or something. \r\n\r\nthe sweater is a very basic, easily adjustable pattern. tweak ’till your heart’s content. use thinner yarn and smaller needles for a smaller sweater or thicker yarn and larger needles for a bigger one, just be sure to adjust the length accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://jenniferhoel.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/garter_cardi_german.pdf\r\n  [2]: http://marizampa.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/cardigan/\r\n  [3]: http://kettlesandmittens.blogspot.com/2010/06/garter-yoke-baby-cardigan-traduccion.html",
