    "content": "scarlet by merin mcmanus collins scarlet is a super-cute hat that is easy to knit and great for a circular knitting newbie even an incredibly slow knitter like me can turn it out in just a few hours the decreases are designed to result in a low-profile crown that fits snugly without being too pointy it s also a great way to show off a lovely handpainted yarn or to use up that one skein of something luscious that you just had to have size ladies m finished measurements length 8 5 inches laid flat circumference approx 18 inches materials mc brown sheep lamb s pride bulky 85% wool 15% mohair 125yd/114m per 113g/4oz skein color unknown semi-solid red possibly m250 cranberry swirl 1 skein needles to suit your choice of circular knitting methods in size to obtain gauge this could include one 32 inch or longer circular for magic loop two circulars one 16 inch circular plus 4 or 5 dpns 5 is recommended set of 4 or 5 dpns 5 is recommended notions required tapestry needle one large 1 5 inch diameter button 4 stitch markers optional gauge 13 sts/16 row = 4 inches in stockinette stitch after washing pattern notes i actually estimate that this pattern requires three-fourths of a skein about 100 yds of lamb s pride bulky however since i don t have a good way of knowing for sure i ve gone ahead and listed one skein just know that i ve successfully made this hat and two similar ones and still had more than just scraps left over i used us 11/8 0 mm needles however i knit very tightly most people would probably want to use something closer to a us 10 note that if you use the long-tail cast-on method and immediately join in the round as opposed to knitting a few row flat first you will want to purl your first round instead of knitting it this is because ltco actually creates a knitted row as part of the process feel free to disregard this instruction if you are not as ocd as me i realize that hat patterns do not usually specify washing however i really feel that it s necessary if you re going to use lamb s pride i find it scratchy on its own but after a quick wool wash bath it s much nicer i ve also had widely varied experience with washing this yarn including a pair of hats that grew about 25% so if you think it ever might need a bath you will want to swatch-and-wash beforehand so you don t wind up with a hat to fit a giant pattern co 56 sts join being careful not to twist work in garter stitch knit one round purl one round until you have 8 garter ridges or until the brim measures approximately 3 inches work in stockinette stitch knit every round until you have approximately 3 inches of stockinette or approximately 6"
