  "notes": "the pattern is for an infinity scarf, with a matching hat. both use front post stitches, and the hat also uses back post stitches - this is what gives both a nice thick, chunky texture.\r\n\r\nincluded in the pattern are recommended colours, and colour sequences, as well as lots of photos and written instructions on how to complete each item. also included are suggestions on how to make the hat in different sizes for children.\r\n\r\ni have also included tips on how to create a neat join at the end of the scarf, and how to join yarn at each colour change.\r\n\r\nyou will need:\r\n\r\n* dk yarn in several different colours (i have recommended stylecraft special dk - and i used 5 different colours - which is more than enough to complete both projects)\r\n* 5.00 and 4.50 crochet hooks\r\n* scissors, darning needle\r\n\r\nthe pattern is written in uk terms and mainly uses front post \r\ntreble crochet and back post treble crochet (for the hat), and also double crochet.\r\n\r\nscarf gauge -  10cm x 10cm square on the scarf is approx. 17 stitches across & 13 rows high.\r\n\r\nhat gauge -  10cm x 10cm square on the hat is approx. 19 stitches across and 12 rows high.\r\n\r\n",
