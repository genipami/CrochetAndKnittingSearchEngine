  "notes": "these mittens fail terribly at warming your hands, but look fabulous on your christmas tree! they are knit in the round in one piece on dpns and because they only have 6 rounds, they take minutes to make! i especially like their bobble thumbs! i used worsted, but for even tinier mittens you could use fingering or sock! enjoy and stay warm! if you like this pattern you may also like my [mini boots and stockings!][2]\r\n\r\nhope you enjoy this free pattern!\r\nhappy knitting!\r\nnatasha\r\n\r\n\r\n> **praise for mini mittens**\r\n> \r\n> another fun, quick knit, took only\r\n> about 15 minutes. the bobble thumb is\r\n> genius!
