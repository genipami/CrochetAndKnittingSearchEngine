  "notes": "how to crochet the little pebbles beanie, a fun crocheted beanie worked in a combination of single crochets and treble crochets to create a cozy, textured crochet pattern and your favorite worsted weight yarn.\r\n\r\n**matching aligned cobble stitch patterns:**\r\n- [little pebbles ear warmer][1]\r\n- [little pebbles scarf][2]\r\n- view the entire [little pebbles collection][3]\r\n\r\n**materials:**\r\n- worsted weight yarn - i used berroco vintage in the horizon blue colorway\r\n- h8/5mm crochet hook\r\n- soft tape measure - gauge is essential\r\n\r\n**yardage by size:**\r\n- newborn: 63 yards (29 grams)\r\n- 3-6 months: 81 yards (37 grams)\r\n- 6-12 months: 120 yards (55 grams)\r\n- toddler: 134 yards (61 grams)\r\n- child: 206 yards (95 grams)\r\n- woman’s size: 234 yards (107 grams)\r\n- adult large: 305 yards (140 grams)\r\n\r\n**material notes:**\r\nrecently, i've learned from my friend krissy of krissy's over the mountain crochet that as a beanie for cancer patients, the best yarn for a sensitive head is going to be a bamboo blend, like berroco modern cotton or lion brand coboo. some can tolerate 100% acrylic or wool, but not all can. with this said, if you'll be donating your beanie, i recommend looking up the requirements from the organization. some say not to use wool yarns. some say not to use red heart super saver (though i think this is a great yarn that really softens nicely after washing, and wears and washes so well). some request the beanies to be washed prior to donating. each has it's own set of guidelines so you'll want to check with the organization first.\r\n\r\nas a cold weather beanie, animal fibers are better for keeping warm against the wind, and while alpaca works great, my go-to is always a 100% superwash merino wool, like wecrochet swish yarn, or a wool and acrylic blend, like lion brand wool ease and berroco vintage. all of these that i've mentioned hold up well to wear and tear and machine washing and drying. acrylic yarns do okay in cool weather as long as it’s not that windy, otherwise, the wind goes right through them.\r\n\r\n**sizes:**\r\nnewborn, 3-6 months, 6-12 months, toddler, child, adult small and adult large\r\n\r\n**gauge (essential), in the round in pattern after round 4:**\r\n- 10 stitches = 3 1/8\"\r\n- 12 stitches = 3 3/8\"\r\n\r\ngauge it very important for beanies. if you do not meet gauge, and continue making your beanie, the finished size will either be too small or too big so make sure to check it at the end of round 4.\r\n\r\nif you're measuring smaller than the given measurements, go up a crochet hook size and rework the sample. if you're measuring larger than the given measurements, go down a crochet hook size and rework the sample. take gauge again, and see where you are.\r\n\r\n**abbreviations (us terms):**\r\n- sc - single crochet\r\n- tr - treble crochet\r\n- blo - back loop only\r\n\r\n**do you offer free patterns and pdfs?**\r\nyes! head over to [my cre8tion crochet blog][4] where you’ll find hundreds of free crochet patterns including this one. you can view the free crochet only from my blog at any time, or subscribe to my blog to download the free pdf of this pattern via the free file library – you’ll find the tab on the top menu. the library is password protected so sign up for my newsletter and you’ll receive a welcome email containing this month’s password. from the library, you’ll be able to access the pdfs via google drive – you do not need to have a google drive account to view and download the pdf. i earn my income from the views my blog sees, but if you’d rather not subscribe, i completely understand and appreciate your support here on ravelry! i also share free crochet patterns at [yarn crafts & coffee][5] and [eyeloveknots][6].\r\n\r\n**about your instant digital purchase:**\r\nthis is a 14 page pdf containing written instructions, and two photos - the main photo on page 1 and a photo on the last page that goes hand and hand with the pattern notes section.
