    "content": "a beanie with a simple mushroom colorwork motif uses 75-100 yards for background color and 25-30 yards for mushroom color depending on the size made pattern describes the use of two colors only but adding strips of color in the background can also work well see photos added jan 25 2020 project notes indicate that this hat often comes out smaller than expected perhaps in part due to the long floats in the colorwork please consider adding an extra pattern repeat using larger needles for the colorwork and/or keeping floats as loose as reasonably possible"
