  "notes": "this is the **seaside stash busting blanket** - which i hosted as a 35 week ‘crochet along’ on my blog \r\nwww.coastalcrochet.com from january - september 2018. all the details remain on my blog. it became a \r\nworldwide community project with people from over 50 different countries crocheting this blanket!\r\nthe original blanket was made using only yarns i had in my stash. the variety of stitch combinations and \r\ncolours were inspired each week by the textures and colours of the seaside.\r\n\r\n**the full pattern is now available as a 10 page printer friendly pdf in my ravelry store.**\r\n\r\nthe pattern remains free over on my blog in 35 weekly instalments.\r\nhttps://coastalcrochet.com/\r\n\r\nall the details for week 1 are here: https://coastalcrochet.com/2018/01/19/this-is-exciting-im-hosting-a-crochet-along-part-1/\r\n\r\nit's a fun project which is designed to use up existing stash, so be creative with colours!"
