  "notes": "have too many plastic bags flopping around? call upon this noble opossum to aid you! your new friend will contain them in its stretchy belly and dispense them though its mouth.\r\n\r\nreduce, reuse, regurgitate!\r\n\r\nyou will need:\r\nworsted weight yarn in light gray, dark gray, white, pink, and beige\r\n12mm safety eyes\r\n\r\n**notes**: \r\n**this is a free pattern! i if you find this pattern for sale, on etsy or elsewhere, it has been stolen.**\r\n\r\ncheck the number of rounds for each step. skipping any rounds in the main body may lead to the head being misaligned at the end!\r\n\r\non **color changes**, since this seems to have caused confusion:\r\nwhen the instructions say, for example,  \r\n\r\n\"*sc12 in gray, sc switching to white...*\"\r\n\r\nwhat i mean is sc 12 in gray, then start the next sc by pulling up a loop in gray, then pull up white to pull though both loops and finish the stitch. then continue on in white. if you would rather do color changes some other way, then just sc 13 in grey, then switch to white however you do it.",
