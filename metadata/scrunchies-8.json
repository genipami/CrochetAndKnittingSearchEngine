  "notes": "scrunchies have made an unbelievable comeback in recent months. although some might say scrunchies never really went out of style. would you believe this pattern is how i created my own scrunchies back in the 80s?\r\n\r\nyou'll need 45 yards of dk weight yarn (multi color cake works great because you can divide it into colors for multiple scrunchies). f 3.75 mm crochet hook. 2\" diameter hair elastic. scissors, yarn needle. and i like to use a very small drop of clear nail polish on any last stitches, ends and knots to secure them.\r\n\r\nthere is also a step-by-step tutorial video for this pattern."
