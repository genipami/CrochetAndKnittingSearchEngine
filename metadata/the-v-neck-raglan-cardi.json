  "notes": "this is a cute and simple baby/toddler cardigan pattern, featuring a top-down raglan design with a v-neck. easily customisable with short sleeves, pockets, applique etc, and great in a solid colour, variegated, or stripes.\r\n\r\nstitches used in pattern (us terms):\r\nsc, hdc, dc, fpdc, bpdc, 2hdc (increase), 2hdctog (decrease)\r\n\r\nbeing a fairly simple pattern i'd say it's suitable from confident beginner upwards.\r\n\r\nthis pattern has been tested, but there may still be errors. feel free to contact me if you notice anything that needs editing or clarification!
