    "content": "to guide you remember that the only thing you re doing differently in this round from the k2 p2 pattern of the round before is that the first k2 p2 k2 of your 12 stitch segment has become k6 the two purl stitches in the middle are now being knit in preparation for the cable so if you ever find yourself purling where the previous row was knit then you will know something is off and that you need to go back a ways and re-count main hat pattern cable twist your six stitch cable left or right whichever you prefer purl 2 knit 2 purl 2 *repeat plain knit 6 purl 2 knit 2 purl 2 *repeat all around for 6 rounds repeat these seven rounds 6 7 7 times ending on a cable twist round don t continue on with the plain rounds yet remember to be gentle when you twist your cables and resist the urge to pull them too tight when the hat stretches you don t want your beautiful cables flattened and straining at the seams crown shaping before you begin the crown shaping carefully try on your hat or attempt to place it on the head of its intended recipient to make sure it s long enough it should comfortably reach your earlobes the crown shaping goes pretty fast and will give you maybe another half inch or so if it s too long or too short for your tastes at this point then now is the time to either rip back a few rounds or knit a few more rounds plain until you re satisfied with the fit basic approach because of the stretchy double ribs on either side of the cables this is a very forgiving crown to shape and we don t need to worry too much about calculating a perfect dome only creating an attractive pattern we re going to start the crown shaping by chipping away at the cables from the inside by alternating left and right leaning decreases abbreviated as lld and rld until they are all eaten the last knit stitch will be eaten by one of the purl stitches from the ribs next to it leaving you with a nice point at the top of your cable then the k2 ribs will begin chipping away at the purls on either side of them until those are gone then they will each take a bite out of each other and you will finally gather the last 10 11 12 stitches about halfway through you can switch to your smaller size needles which i think makes things a little neater looking but it s not absolutely necessary so if you forget to in the heat of the moment don t worry 1st decrease round you should be at your start marker about to knit across a cable knit 2 make a left leaning decrease knit 2 purl 2 knit 2 purl 2 *repeat all around you should have"
