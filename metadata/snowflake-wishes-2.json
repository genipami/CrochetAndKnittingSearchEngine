  "notes": "snowflake wishes - simple, quick snowflakes which when blocked with pva glue and glitter make pretty christmas tree ornaments. perfect to slip in a holiday card for friends and colleagues.\r\n\r\nthis pattern has two variations - the larger is around 8-10cm across (3-4in) and the smaller around 7-8cm across (2.75-3 in). \r\nthe snowflakes work with any yarn but i designed it with dk through aran weights in mind.\r\n\r\nin addition to yarn you will need a needle to sew in ends, and optionally ribbon or thread, pva glue, and glitter.\r\n\r\n\r\nstay up to date - you can follow me on facebook if you'd like to keep up to date with future patterns: [facebook.com/wishesintherain][1] ♥\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.facebook.com/wishesintherain"
