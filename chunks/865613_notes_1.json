    "content": "these little pierogi pals are super adorable and work up very quickly i started making them a few years ago to be christmas ornaments as pierogi are very special in my family the pattern that i ve linked has three different styles of pierogi patterns in it the tidy pierogi the fancy pierogi in photo and the banana pierogi as anyone who has ever made real pierogi will know some of them come out a bit wonky and they needed some crochet representation"
