    "content": "this is the sixth pattern in a series of patterns which utilizes the extra loop of half_double_crochet stitches which is one of my favorite crochet techniques that creates a knit-look this pattern is perfect for the fall and winter weather it s a simple made-to-measure pattern that complements the calli cowl so i m also naming this one after my partner who is the most thoughtful person i know and makes my life better every day i love you calli **what you ll need ** tools 9 00 mm crochet hook or size appropriate for chosen yarn scissors measuring tape yarn roughly 120 yards of weight 6 super bulky yarn i used two skeins of colorway astroland in lion s brand wool ease thick and quick my holy grain yarn i have also made adult-sized beanies in this pattern using just one skein 250 yards of lion brand s heartland weight 4 yarn **construction notes ** the calli beanie is a made to measure pattern you can use any weight yarn and make any size beanie so yardage will vary the pattern is worked top to bottom in row rather than in rounds so your starting chain is going to be the height of your beanie - not the fit around your head a longer starting chain will make a slouchier beanie and a shorter starting chain will make a more fitted beanie keep in mind that your starting length needs to account for the fold-over brim of the beanie finally note that this beanie is essentially worked into a long rectangle which is then seamed into a tubed and cinched at the top"
