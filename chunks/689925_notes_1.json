    "content": "worked in a lightweight yarn this hat is perfect for blustery autumn days that are just starting to cool off the textured stitch is simple enough to show off colour changing variegated or self striping yarns but is interesting enough for a solid or tonal for when you want something more nondescript the hat is designed to slouch just a little enough to be on trend but not so much that it threatens to fall off your head it s not slouchy it s slouchish but if you re feeling a little slouchier the pattern includes instructions to make it so i m not here to judge tips for making extended sizes and working in different weights of yarn are also included this hat does require light blocking to hang properly ~~~ *as always if you have questions or concerns please don t hesitate to message me on ravelry or leave a query in the comment section *"
