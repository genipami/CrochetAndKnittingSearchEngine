    "content": "**description** i developed this pattern to solve two problems my surfeit of fingering yarn and my aversion to knitting thumbs if you too possess a stash full of fingering yarn and hate knitting fiddly little thumbs this pattern is for you this is essentially a one-size-fits-almost-all pattern it fits my daughter s average-size hands yet has enough negative ease to also fit snugly on my smaller narrower ones the ribbing at the top is tall enough to be folded down for shorter hands or left extended for more coverage the cuff is a comfortable to me 2 5-inch length best of all there are no thumbs to knit once you are done let us not revisit the trauma i experienced that one december i was knitting six pairs of mitts and foolishly decided to leave all the thumbs 12 thumbs to be knitted last let us also not contemplate the number of mitts-in-progress that continue to wait forlornly and in vain for me to knit them their teeny tiny appendages the feelings of regret and guilt are overwhelming is what i m saying hence to spare you the same i offer this adjustable no-thumbs pattern enjoy note on needle size the suggested needle sizes on this page are just estimates your larger needle needs to give you a gauge of 7 stitches and 11 row per inch in stockinette in the round the smaller needle will be one size below that for most people the larger needle should be somewhere between a 1 2 25 mm and a 3 3 25 mm for people like me who knit very loosely it is a 00 1 75 mm which is insane but there you are"
