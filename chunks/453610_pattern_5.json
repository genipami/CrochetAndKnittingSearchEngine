    "content": "instead of knits refer to the section knitting the mate of the knitty pattern for details row 4 ws knit sts between cuff and adjacent marker i-marker on needle 1 d-marker on needle 2 work the rest of the pattern as specified in main instructions row 5 rs work as row 3 work the next three row row 6-8 exactly as instructed in knitty article then repeat row 3-8 throughout the remainder of the pattern note when you get to stage 3 the knitty instructions direct you to remove all i-markers and d-markers but i like to leave in placeholders at the transition between leg and heel to keep track of where to start and end the ribbing knitting off the grid making wraptor at any gauge this section is for adventurous knitters i won t say for experts because i encourage novice knitters to jump into anything that looks interesting after all that s how you learn but just to set the right expectations i make no claims about this next section being particularly easy in principle wraptor is divided into 3 sections the stages that each run the entire length of the sock plus a 4th that provides extra material at the instep each of the stages is 1/3 the total width and can at least theoretically be knit to any gauge the schematic below shows an abstraction of the 3 stages and a guide to the locations of the increases and decreases gauge if you were hoping that an off-the-grid approach would save you from the chore of knitting a gauge swatch i have bad news you re out of luck but the good news is you don t have to match anyone else s gauge just work a swatch take your measurements and go to the next section length before you knit wraptor off the standard gauge you need to know how to measure for your cast on 1 measure foot diagonal length refer to the diagram at left to see start and end points of this measurement starting on the top of your left foot at the base of the big toe wrap the measuring tape around the outside of your foot to the bottom just before the base of your heel as a point of reference i have a size 10 foot and my foot diagonal length is 7 3/8 7 375 inches 2 multiply foot diagonal length by 0 87 for a 13% negative ease for example for my foot 7 375 x 0 87 = 6 4 3 as you cast on place stitch markers to separate toe foot heel and leg at the following distances * toe 3 sts all gauges all sizes insert t-marker foot varies per individual in my case 6 4 insert i-marker heel bottom 1 75 insert md-marker heel top 3 insert d-marker leg 6 25 note final leg height above the heel will be 4 5 if you prefer taller simply cast on more stitches expect"
