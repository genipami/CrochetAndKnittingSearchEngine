    "content": "looking for some non-breakable more or less cat-proof christmas decorations i found inspiration in all the wonderful ornament patterns out there since i don t have a christmas tree i decided to knit some pieces to make a garland i don t like seaming therefore they are all constructed to be knit in the round i also tried to keep the individual pieces in proportion to each other gauge is not important just go for the yarn and needles that give you a fabric that you like to give you an idea regarding size though the clothes depicted in the pattern were knitted using 4ply sock yarn the longjohns are about 15 cm 6 in tall and fit into the coat and trousers all you need to make a set yourself is some yarn a set of 5 double pointed needles or circulars for magic loop and some time it s up to you if you want to knit just one garment or a few use them as decoration for the tree as tags for gifts or make your own garland with some cooking twine for the laundry line and small clothes pins as sold to hang up holiday cards ---- rather than selling the pattern and donating the proceeds to charity i ve decided to ask for donations - so if you enjoyed knitting this please consider spreading the love and holiday cheer by donating to my fundraising page for m\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res https //justgiving nl/en/elli-knits a big thank you also to frankie brown http //www ravelry com/designers/frankie-brown for letting me use her stocking pattern for the boots"
