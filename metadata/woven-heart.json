  "notes": "this crochet woven heart is both useful and decorative. it's very similar to those paper decorations you might have made in art class in school.\r\n\r\nthis pattern is fast and easy to make with 2 strands of yarn held together. i would suggest cotton if you are going to use this as a useful item in the kitchen and bath. acrylic yarn is fine for decorative purposes.\r\n\r\nas always i have a step-by-step tutorial video for this pattern! enjoy, donna wolfe from naztazia"
