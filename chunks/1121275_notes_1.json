    "content": "the faye cowl is a one-piece cowl that is knitted in two parts the outside first on larger needles and then the inside second on smaller there are separate charts for the inside and outside of the cowl and once it is complete the inside is pulled through the outside folded in half and grafted together the two different needle sizes allow the inside to hug the neck for a very cozy effect approximately 100 yards of each of two colors are needed but due to difference in gauge you may want to budget slightly more of the main color - you will not need all 100 yards of the contrasting color i suggest using up small balls of leftover for the colorwork in the style of fair isle knitting this cowl was designed using a swedish motif for the outside and a faroese motif for the inside it is named for faye the daughter of a swedish friend the construction method and shape are inspired by the radiant star cowl by ella gordon from the shetland wool week annual 2020 check this out if you get a chance - the pattern and color palette are incredible all credit to ella for her work designing a shape that is so well fitting cozy and wonderful in the spirit of fair isle knitting i did not at all intend to copy or profit from her design but to use an innovative method to put a new spin on something and i want to thank her for creating such a brilliant base pattern https //www ravelry com/patterns/library/radiant-star-cowl for a video to see how to graft the cowl together you can visit https //www youtube com/watch v=5i-08iddpf0&ab_channel=barnabyknits"
