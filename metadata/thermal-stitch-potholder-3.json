  "notes": "learn a new stitch while crocheting a useful project. the thermal stitch creates a nice, thick fabric that is perfect for potholders. when using cotton yarn, the potholder will not melt and will protect your hands when removing hot dishes from the oven.\r\n\r\nthese potholders make great gifts for many occasions! choose the recipients’ favorite colors, or their kitchen colors, for a thoughtful gift! use full skeins of yarn or scraps of yarn for an eclectic look!\r\n\r\nwatch my youtube video to learn the thermal single crochet stitch and crochet this potholder along with me: https://youtu.be/djysoyjqy8i.\r\n\r\nto learn to change colors on the potholder, watch my youtube video here: https://youtu.be/tjhefnfdlbk.
