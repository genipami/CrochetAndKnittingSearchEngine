    "content": "when it comes to crocheting clothing i m always looking for the easy way out the traditional idea of making a front or two the sleeves a back and piecing them all together - it s just too finicky for me so when i hit upon the idea of making a short-sleeved cardigan out of two long rectangles i was all over it it s worked in a mesh so it s fast too light and breezy for summer this little cardi is perfect for throwing on over a tee or a sundress for just a little more coverage"
