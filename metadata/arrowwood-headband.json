  "notes": "check out the other two patterns in the fall into autumn collection 1 here:\r\n\r\n* [sunflower beanie][2]\r\n* [autumn adventures beanie][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n***the inspiration***\r\n\r\nthere is nothing more exciting than the anticipation of autumn. feeling the first hints of crispness in the air, watching the leaves turn crimson and gold, and tasting the warm flavor of a pumpkin spice latte are some of my favorite small joys each year. but of course, fall wouldn’t be complete without headbands!\r\n\r\n\r\n***the construction***\r\n\r\ni designed this beautiful lace piece with the aim of making lace knitting simple and easy to understand. it’s a great first lace project because the yarn is bulky so it works up quickly and you can see what you’re doing. also, it’s a small piece so if worst comes to worst, it won’t hurt too much if you have to rip it out and start over. i've also included a helpful photo tutorial for the tricky stitch to make learning extra easy!\r\n\r\n\r\n***the yarn***\r\n\r\nthe yarn i used for this pattern is [stitch please chunky by premier yarns.][4] i used the colorway \"salted caramel.\" i’ve tried so many wool yarns over the years, and they’re often scratchy and uncomfortable to wear. not this one! it’s 100% wool, yet it feels soft and luxurious to the touch, and it comes in so many beautiful colors to choose from! the best part is that it’s extremely affordable to fit any budget. give it a try, you’ll love it! one thing to note is that stitch please chunky is on the lighter side of bulky, so make sure to not use a heavy bulky yarn, as your headband will become too wide. however, you could substitute a heavier worsted weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n***materials***\r\n\r\n* approximately 36 yards (33 m) of a bulky weight (5) yarn.\r\n\r\n* us size 10 (6mm) knitting needles.\r\n\r\n* common notions, such as measuring tape, yarn needle, and scissors.\r\n\r\n\r\n***measurements***\r\n\r\napproximately 18” (46 cm) around and 5” (13 cm) wide. don’t worry, it’s super stretchy!\r\n\r\n\r\n***gauge***\r\n\r\n6 sts x 10 rows = 2” in lace pattern\r\n\r\n\r\n***disclaimer***\r\n\r\nyou are more than welcome to sell anything you make using this pattern; i just ask that you credit me as the designer. you may not claim this pattern as your own, and you may not sell or distribute its contents in any form. if you have any questions, you can reach me by email at thechesapeakeneedle@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n***sharing***\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy this knitting pattern! also, i’d love to see your work! tag me in your photos on instagram using @thechesapeakeneedle, #thechesapeakeneedle, and #arrowwoodheadband so that i can find you easily! i just might share your photos on my page. see you there!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://thechesapeakeneedle.blog/2023/01/25/free-knitting-pattern-arrowwood-headband/\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/sunflower-beanie-8\r\n  [3]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/autumn-adventures-beanie\r\n  [4]: https://www.premieryarns.com/products/sp100wcnky?aff=51\r\n  [5]: http://eepurl.com/dnmt1r\r\n  [6]: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/610941505719181748/\r\n  [7]: https://www.pinterest.com/thechesapeakeneedle\r\n  [8]: https://www.ravelry.com/designers/lindsey-faciane\r\n  [9]: https://www.instagram.com/thechesapeakeneedle",
