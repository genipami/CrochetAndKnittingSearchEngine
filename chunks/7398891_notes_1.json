    "content": "i designed this hat to match a sweater my friend bought the hat has cables honeycomb cables and rib stitching it is fun and easy to make the row repeat throughout the pattern so it can be easy to memorize i recommend putting stitch markers between each element so you do not have to think too hard while knitting this is not written in the pattern the pattern repeats every 26 stitches so it would be difficult to make a larger or smaller size unless you added extra stitches in the k2 p2 k2 section or used much smaller yarn i have not had anyone test the pattern so make it at your own risk i have knitted it twice and it turned out well i have no idea what the gauge is or how large the hat is when it is completed it has already been given to molly i knitted it with aran woolen mills yarn and it turned out the right size for an adult i calculated that i used 211 5m to knit the hat including the pompom good luck"
