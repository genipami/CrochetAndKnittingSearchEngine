  "notes": "this is an easy pattern for a comfy hat.  one skein of 107 yards is perfect and will leave enough yarn for an optional pom pom.\r\n\r\ni have made this pattern with beginners in mind to keep it simple and fun.  i used my circular needles for the entire project.  also, i know as a beginner you have limited tools and there is no need to invest in another set of needles for the project.  however, feel free to use dpn’s for the decreasing rows, they would also work great for the hat.\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy making this hat. i would love to see the hats you made from the pattern.\r\n\r\nplease feel free to tag me on your instagram posts or follow me for a little bit of inspiration @mor_oddz_n_endz",
