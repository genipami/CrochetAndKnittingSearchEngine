  "notes": "these toe-up, short row heel socks are crocheted using the herringbone half double crochet stitch. available in five sizes from women's 5 to men's 13, whip a pair up for all of your favorite people. ♥\r\n\r\npattern notes:\r\n\r\nmark the first st of each row with a stitch marker.\r\n\r\ndo not turn throughout the pattern, except when working the heel rows.\r\n\r\nyou could continue the “ankle” rows to make the socks as short or tall as you like.\r\n\r\npattern written using us terms.\r\n\r\neach size is separated out individually.\r\n\r\nthese socks are stretchy! they have a negative ease and may appear too small while working them up.\r\n\r\nuse the tail from the beginning chain to cinch up any holes in the toe as you weave in the end.\r\n\r\nwe are using the herringbone half double crochet stitch. watch the tutorial for this stitch here: https://hearthookhome.com/how-to-herringbone-half-double-crochet-hhdc/\r\n\r\nthe entire sock is worked in continuous rounds with the exception of the heel. the heel is worked in rows, then we switch back to rounds (picking up where we left off) to finish the “ankle” and “leg”."
