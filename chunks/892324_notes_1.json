    "content": "this is a handy and super fun little dice bag or sundries bag for the squid lover in your life size is adjusted by using heavier weight yarns and bigger hooks i chose to make the bottom in single_crochet and the rest of the bag in half_double_crochet because not everyone will use this as a dice bag and i wanted the holes to be as minimal as possible i have made this pattern using fingering weight yarn dk weight yarns and worsted weight yarns from a vast number of places the only thing that changes is the hook size and the eye size if you want them to be bigger on a bigger bag i used a lot of my scrap yarn making these bags because it takes so little yardage to work them up and because mixing colors is kind of fun on something so small and silly"
