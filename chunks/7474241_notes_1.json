    "content": "this pattern is designed with bottom up construction it is an all around 3x2 rib designed to fit with negative ease this pattern was designed as a made-to-measure pattern there will be specific inputs required of you particular body measurements and your gauge and calculations are in place to determine the numbers in the pattern i would also like to be transparent that the pattern does not have any waist or bust shaping i made sure my swatch had enough give to stretch more and avoid the shaping these parts but i do understand this will not work for everyone unfortunately i am not a skilled enough pattern designer or experienced enough knitter to have a good grasp on how to implement these elements but it is something i want to learn for the future to achieve a similar gauge as me here are the details of the yarn i used worsted weight 100% wool yarn with 4 5mm needles with these specifications the top took me about 3 5 100g balls of yarn my measurements are in the calcs tab as the default for your reference as well i would recommend avoiding super-wash wool cotton or other fibers that are notorious for growing a lot after blocking as this will likely block out to much larger and looser a fit than the pattern intends if you have any resources feedback or questions about the pattern please reach out to me"
