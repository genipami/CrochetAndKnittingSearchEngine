    "content": "with winter fast approaching i start thinking about the delights of chunky cabled sweaters the only downside of heavily cabled sweaters is that they can take a long time to knit socks on the other hand are a much faster knit granted chunky cables and socks don t often play well together cables tend to absorb negative ease and too many chunky cables on the instep can make squeezing a sock into a shoe a bit of a challenge intermingle addresses both of these issues the cable appears as one panel surrounded by stockinette stitches this allows the stockinette to provide the much-needed negative ease additionally the cable gets split in half at the instep so the sock isn t too bulky when worn inside of shoes the cables are mirrored just to keep things interesting errata the correct heel set up instructions are right heel set up work 20 sts in pattern stop here left heel set up work 56 60 64 sts in pattern stop here"
