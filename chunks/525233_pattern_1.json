    "content": "i want that wrap this is a simple wrap that was created in the summer of 2014 out of a stash of 3 skeins of wool yarn purchased for another project that was not needed i had tried on a woven wool wrap in a shop and thought i could knit something very similar i used a beach towel and safety pins to fold the towel to the dimensions that i liked then measured the length and width following those dimensions and some basic calculations from a swatch of the yarn i started knitting a pattern i had recently finished a garment that used an i-cord edge so thought i would use that technique for the edges of my wrap to keep them from curling it has turned out to be a very useful and comfortable wrap when wearing it to a knitting retreat that fall several of the other participants asked me for the pattern i hadn t written anything down so had to rely on measurements and counting stitches to create the first pattern and placed it on ravelry the original version of the pattern was so well received that i decided it was time to rewrite a better version this version is meant to explain some of the simple techniques used and give some information for beginning knitters how to adjust the pattern to fit them just the way they want abbreviations ws wrong side sts stitches rs right side wyif with yarn in front co cast on wyib with yarn in back p purl sl slip k knit needle size 10 yarn used ella rae classic wool 3 skeins worsted weight 100gr each aprox 650 yards total guage 12 sts and 16 row = 4 x 4 finished dimensions after blocking 21in wide by 62in long how to create the i-cord edge a simple i-cord edge is created along each edge by slipping the last 3 sts of each row this leaves the working yarn 3 stitched in but just continue the next row as normal reaching the yarn over to knit or purl each of the first 3 sts keep the working yarn relaxed do not pull it tight the first few row will look odd but after a few more row you will be able to see how nice the edges look this will also keep them from rolling how to adjust the pattern for your size the original wrap was made to fit my 5 4 height to figure out the number of knit and purl repeats you will need for your desired dimensions you will need to first knit a 4 x4 swatch then use a little math to determine the total number of stitches it will take to create the width of the wrap the number of stripes of knits and purls can be adjusted as needed directions co 62 sts using long tail method row 1 ws p10 k3 4 times p7 sl the last 3 sts purl wise wyif"
