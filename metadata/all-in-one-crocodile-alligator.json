  "notes": "this is my simple all in one crocodile pattern. it is designed to be worked in one piece without having to join on any other parts.\r\n\r\nit takes around 30 mins to complete one croc. very useful for gifts as it works up quickly and easily.\r\n\r\nyou can use any weight / ply of yarn. it is great for stash busting!\r\n\r\nplease see my other all in one patterns.  \r\n\r\nalso, please do not upload the pattern into facebook group files without permission. if you could just share a link to this page that would be great.....thank you!",
