    "content": "a modern take on classic aran cables this headband is comfortable warm and chic a tightly woven braid with a small garter stitch border makes it both attractive and functional on a cool day this headband is a great small project for beginning cable knitters a how-to reference table for cable stitches used is included on the pattern and the pattern itself looks complicated but is quite easy gauge is not really important but do be consistent with it and as this is a small project you should be able to complete it with a relatively small amount of yarn perhaps leftovers from a different project"
