  "notes": "this tank top has super-easy construction and uses very basic stitches, making it great for the advanced-beginner crocheter who'd like to try his/her first garment.\r\n\r\ninstructions are provided for increasing / decreasing the size of the tank. \r\n\r\ndue to the nature of the pattern, the suggested dk yarn could easily be substituted for sport weight yarn if you'd like something lighter or even a worsted weight for a heavier tank.\r\n\r\n**stitches used:** ch, sl-st, sc, dc\r\n\r\n**format: ** the pattern is written and includes a partial symbol chart and schematics for assembly.\r\n\r\n**update (july 4): ** i've had a couple of questions about the method used for joining the corners in the squares. i've made a video illustrating the first 4 rows of the squares to help show how it's done.
