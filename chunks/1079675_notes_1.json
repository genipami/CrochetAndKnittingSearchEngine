    "content": "a twiddle muff is made to provide both warmth for the hands and also something soft to fiddle with to decrease anxiety size is not extremely important this pattern is great to use up scrap yarn you can use as many colors or different textures of yarn as you want you don t even have to weave in your ends just knot your yarns together leaving the tails approx 1 long loose on the inside of the muff- creating more textures to twiddle i like to use one color mc for the odd numbered stripes and use a different cc for the even numbered stripes"
