    "content": "*i m not sure what is going on with the gauge for this pattern i measured it carefully but it seems like it is turning out too small for almost everyone it could be the yarn a very slippery rayon or that i wore it a few times before measuring but i am going to try to get to the bottom of this before anyone else ends up with a really tiny top but i love all your projects * this is my first pattern for ravelry but it is untested plus i wrote it up after the fact instead of while i was doing it but the shaping is pretty simple and i measured the real piece i guessed on the hook size though but i use f for all dk yarns i just realized this page does not mention that only one size is currently available in the pattern medium/large because of the butterflies it is difficult to just size this pattern up please note this pattern uses u s crochet terminology"
