  "notes": "feel the bern is a little yoke cropped sweater inspired by bernie sander's iconic mittens worn at the 2021 presidential inauguration. the mittens (and bernie) were the unexpected fashion moment of the day, and i could not live without a sweater to match! the original mittens were made by jen ellis, a schoolteacher who makes them from recycled sweaters, so a new sweater design based on mittens made from old sweaters feels like the full knitter circle! \r\n\r\nthis free pattern has not been test knitted or tech edited, that is why it is free! this is a fun little gift to the knitting community made in the spirit of celebration and spreading kindness. pattern support is not available for free patterns, but i do my best to make sure patterns are error-free and updated as needed. this design used my most popular pattern- the [soldotna crop][1] pattern as a template, so i am confident that it will be an enjoyable knit with a lovely result. \r\n\r\ni will be knitting my own sample from [magpie fibers nest worsted][2], and will share photos as it progresses! it would also be lovely in nest sport held together with feather mohair for a fluffy version!\r\n\r\nin lieu of payment for this pattern, i would love if you would consider making a donation to [meals on wheels][3], your local food pantry, or a similar organization that supports ending hunger. bernie's motto is \"not me, us\" and i hope knitting this sweater will be a reminder to serve our communities and work toward creating a better world for everyone.\r\n\r\nthe design can easily be lengthened if crops aren't your style, instructions are included in the pattern. this design is simple enough for an adventurous beginner, yet still engaging for advanced knitters. best of all, the cropped length and sleeveless style make this a super quick and gratifying project. the body length is easily adjustable; keep in mind changes will alter the yardage required.\r\n\r\n**materials**\r\n**yarn:**\r\nsample uses\r\nmagpie nest worsted\r\n100% non-superwash corriedale\r\n210 yards [192 m]/100 grams\r\n\r\n**colors used in sample:** \r\nc1: natural midnight (dark brown)\r\nc2: twilight beaver (medium brown)\r\nc3: castaway (beige)\r\nc4: natural (cream)\r\n\r\n**needles**\r\nnote! needle size is suggested only, you will need to swatch to determine the needle size needed to achieve gauge.\r\nribbing: us 5/3.75 mm\r\nmain needle: us 7/4.5 mm\r\n\r\n**gauge:**\r\n18 sts and 26 rounds over 4” [10 cm] in stockinette on main needles after blocking\r\n\r\nyou should always knit your swatch the same way that the pattern is knit—in this case, in the round. block your swatch as you will your finished garment and allow it to dry fully before measuring.\r\n\r\n**notions:**\r\nstitch markers, scrap yarn, darning needle\r\n\r\n**yardage:** note that yardage is estimated and may vary depending on yarn used, gauge variations or modifications.\r\n**c1:**  184 (207, 230, 253, 276, 299) {322, 345, 368, 391} yards\r\n*[169 (190, 211, 232, 253, 274) {295, 316, 337, 358} meters]*\r\n**c2:**  274 (308, 343, 377, 412, 446) {480, 514, 548, 584} yards\r\n*[251 (282, 314, 345, 377, 408) {439, 470, 501, 534} meters]*\r\n**c3:** 63 (71, 78, 86, 94, 102) {110, 117, 125, 133} yards\r\n*[58 (65, 72, 79, 86, 94) {101, 107, 115, 122} meters]*\r\n**c4:**  70 (79, 87, 96, 105, 114) {122, 131, 140, 148} yards\r\n*[64 (73, 80, 88, 96, 105) {112, 120, 128, 136} meters]*\r\n\r\n**sizes:**\r\nmeasurements given are for the finished garment. this sweater is designed to fit with 2-4.5” [5-11.5 cm] of positive ease at the bust and 1-2” [2.5-5 cm] of positive ease at the upper arm.\r\nsee size chart on page 5 for complete fit details.\r\n\r\n**1 (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) {7, 8, 9, 10}\r\nfinished circumference at bust:**\r\n32 (36, 40, 44, 48, 52) {56, 60, 64, 68}” \r\n*[81.5 (91.5, 101.5, 112, 122, 132) {142, 152.5, 162.5, 172.5) cm]* \r\n**finished sleeve circumference at upper arm:**\r\n11.25 (12, 13, 13.75, 15.5, 16.5) {19.25, 20.5, 21.5, 22.25}” \r\n*[28 (30.5, 32.5, 35, 39.5, 42) {48.5, 52, 54, 56.5} cm]*\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/soldotna-crop\r\n  [2]: https://www.magpiefibers.com/nest-worsted\r\n  [3]: https://www.mealsonwheelsamerica.org",
