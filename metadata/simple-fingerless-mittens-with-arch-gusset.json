  "notes": "these fingerless mittens are knitted in the round from the cuff up to the top and have an arched gusset that allows for a very comfortable fit. they are cute, warm and very practical for cold weather months. i use them when taking my dogs for a walk, going out early in the morning to feed the chickens or to bring some firewood in.\r\nthese mittens have a very simple colorwork design, so if you have never knitted with 2 colours before, this could be a perfect first project for you.\r\nmittens are knitted on circular needles however you can also use double-pointed needles if you are more comfortable with them. \r\n",
