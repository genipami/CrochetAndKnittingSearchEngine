    "content": "this is my first pattern ever this pattern is uses 27 sunburst granny squares using a rainbow gradient yarn to change the color instead of switching yarns they are stitched together using a flat slip_stitch the straps are also worked using the rainbow yarn to look like a very long granny square and look very cute tied into a bow any gradual rainbow gradient yarn would work well with this pattern what is unique to this pattern is the use of one sided fusible ultra firm stabilizer on the bottom of the bag to give structure and have the bottom sit flat even when there are items in the bag the yarns said they were both worsted weight but the caron was much thicker sizing down the hook helped the yarns meld together better i tend to like denser fabrics too bag dimensions 13in tall x 12in wide x 4in deep straps are both 4ft long yarn needed 120g/600yd or 2 balls of the magic light yarn they are only sold in packs of 4 and 150g/300yd or less than one unit of the caron one pound in the color off white update ice yarns has sold out of the light orchid pink orange and yellow yarn originally used in this pattern the hayfield spirit dk in the color sundown is exactly the same colors and will give you the same results have fun and enjoy your new tote bag"
