  "notes": "i have freakishly small hands (lol) but have tried to make these crochet fingerless mitts a universal size to fit everyone.\r\n\r\ni recommend you complete the first couple of rows and try it on to double check the fit – too baggy? try dropping a hook size (i often use a 3.5mm instead of a 4mm for my own personal gloves) too small? try upping the hook size.\r\n\r\nfull info and pattern up on my blog :-)\r\n\r\ni use cygnet boho spirit for these gloves - i find they have the right amount of softness and stretch.\r\n\r\n\r\nother yarns i occasionally use for these gloves:\r\n\r\n·         red heart unforgettable – you may find you need to up your hook to a 4.5mm or even a 5mm on the shell rows as this yarn doesn’t seem to have much “give” to it. try your gloves on periodically if using this yarn to make sure it still fits your hand nicely. adjust your hook size accordingly.\r\n\r\n·         king cole riot – not as soft as boho spirit and a little finer – should still work ok with a 4mm hook but it’s been a while since i’ve used it so i’d give the same advice for this yarn as i have for the red heart.\r\n\r\n"
