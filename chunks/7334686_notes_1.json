    "content": "these pattern was designed for sock madness 18 and is now available to everybody the pattern follows the idea of steeked socks which was initiated in team itonda in sm 15 why would one want to steek socks as an ornament perhaps is there anything in sock constructions which can be achieved only by steeking and there is no way around it to my opinion yes if one wants fully symmetric socks from a gradient or selfstriping yarn without a repetitive sequence both socks have to be knitted in one round which includes both socks at once and then separated by the steek this is the main idea of this unusual construction i was knitting a lot in my high school and during the study but then when kids came there was a break for more than 25 years my first after sock was a complicated structure with a double sole and fully stranded with skyscrapers i do not have any idea where they have come from the motif of skyscrapers is repeated here"
