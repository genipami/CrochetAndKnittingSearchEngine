  "notes": "this is my go-to vanilla pattern when using self-striping or highly variegated yarns. with a high instep, usually a heel flap and gusset fits best. but i don't like having the stripes disrupted in the instep area, or large sections of pooling that can happen with highly variegated yarns. so a short row heel is preferred for those yarns. however, i still need a gusset for my high instep! hence these socks.\r\n\r\npattern can be worked either toe up or cuff down (instructions included for both). \r\n\r\n6 sizes available\r\n\r\neasily adjustable!\r\n\r\ni have discovered that if i use contrasting yarn (leftovers or minis or whatever) for heels, toes, and cuffs, i can usually get two pairs of adult medium sized socks out of one skein.\r\n\r\nall sizes have been tested.",
