  "notes": "short socks are the bane of my existence because they always fall down into my shoes.  a lot of commercially-made socks prevent this with grippy silicone strips on the inside but that doesn’t help when it comes to knitting your own socks.  so, i have been on a quest to figure out how to knit no-show socks that don’t fall down after a few steps and i think this is the answer!  \r\n\r\nthis “pattern” is only for the cuff and heel tab of the sock and is meant to be used with a flap and gusset heel.  you can pair it with your favorite vanilla pattern or even with a patterned sock - just start the patterning after you pick up the gusset stitches for the heel.  (don’t have a favorite vanilla pattern?  [try mine - it’s free!][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/exceedingly-vanilla-socks"
