  "notes": "the morning dew headband features a brioche stitch that produces a squishy ribbed fabric. the pattern is a 2-row repeat.\r\n\r\nthe first and last 3 stitches form an i-cord edging, that makes the edges look neat and prevents them from curling.\r\n\r\nthe the cast-on and bind-off edges are seamed together forming a decorative twist in the middle. the seam is hidden by the twist and is not visible."
