  "notes": "these mitts are a project i came up with to donate to the treasure box in my child’s second grade class, and to other local charities. i live in a warm climate, so full mittens are impractical most of the time, but every child i know seems to go bonkers over fingerless mitts. \r\n\r\nthese mitts will fit a 4-7 year old child but are easily altered. \r\n\r\n",
