  "notes": "lots of people love balloon animals! but they always have an unfortunate tendency to pop or deflate over time. so why not make a more long-lasting version? this cuddly plush has a beginner-friendly pattern, and makes a perfect companion for any dog and/or balloon lover.\r\n\r\nmaterials:\r\n\r\n* 5mm crochet hook\r\n* worsted weight yarn (about 200g)\r\n* polyester fiberfill\r\n* yarn needle\r\n\r\n(you can use whatever yarn and hook size you’d like, just be aware that it will change the size of the finished product. i used the materials above, and my plush measures 8 ½ inches long and 8 inches tall.)\r\n",
