    "content": "the amazing vintage checkerboard stitch 1 is the whole reason behind this beautiful crochet cowl i had filmed a video tutorial 2 for the stitch which came from a vintage stitch dictionary and liked it so much that i immediately started on this design i used one of last year s fingering weight yarn advents it was gifted so has no particular yarn dyer to attribute together with a 100g of madelinetosh merino light in the colour cosmic wonder dust and a 3mm hook *note you will need approx 200g of any 4ply/fingering weight yarn for this pattern 1 x 100g will be your main colour and the other 100g will come from your advent yarns striped * the original plan was for a long wide scarf i had planned on aggressively blocking the work to make the pattern come to life it looks so amazing blocked but i ended up liking the unblocked version better i also cycled twice through my yarn advent and didn t make two full repeats 46 colour stripes instead of 48 because i ran out of the main colour this is how the pattern ended up being turned into a cowl instead because even after two repeats i still didn t think it was long enough to be a scarf you can use this pattern however you like work it as a scarf a shawl a blanket the stitch multiple is given in the video tutorial so you can go wild i would the pattern is free i hope you love it as much as i do 1 http //www potterandbloom com/blog/checkerboardstitch 2 https //www youtube com/watch v=1h7obv3iyui"
