    "content": "this zippered case was designed to fit an entire set of clover amour crochet hooks with ergonomic handles by changing the case height this pattern can be adapted to fit other hooks with ergonomic handles the pocket heights are tall enough to hold the hooks securely but short enough so that the color of each handle is visible the front cover features a decorative clover to indicate the case contents to provide added protection for the hooks the cover can be given more stiffness through the use of optional plastic inserts into the cover since the hook pockets and case are constructed seamlessly the only sewing involved is at the end to attach the zipper"
