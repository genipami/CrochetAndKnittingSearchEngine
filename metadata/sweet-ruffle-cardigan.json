  "notes": "the sweet ruffle cardigan is knit from the top down, starting with the neck, raglan increase, body, and finally sleeves. the body of the sweater uses a simple stockinette stitch with a ruffle along the bottom edge for the perfect amount of embellishment. you can add personality to the sweater by finishing it with cute buttons. i chose to use bernat softee cotton yarn, but if you live in a colder climate you could also substitute for a soft wool yarn of similar weight for an even warmer sweater.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is available for free for size 6-12m on my blog [www.knitpaintsew.com][1]. if you are looking for additional sizes, you can purchase an ad-free [pdf of the pattern on my etsy shop][2] which includes instructions for 7 sizes: newborn, 0-3m, 3-6m, 6-12m, 12-18m, 18-24m, and 2-4y.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.knitpaintsew.com/blog/sweet-ruffle-cardigan\r\n  [2]: https://www.etsy.com/listing/1886706930/sweet-ruffle-baby-cardigan-pattern"
