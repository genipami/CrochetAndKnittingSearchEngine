    "content": "this pattern is super simple it is finished in only 2 rounds the fun comes in with customization you can add a button to the centre some beads to the loop and a key ring you will need a 4 5mm hook and some worsted cotton yarn but you can easily use a different hook size and different yarn making this a great scrap buster pattern"
