    "content": "this potholder is my take on a potholder my great grandmother crocheted many decades ago her potholder was constructed with rings made from double crochets around rubber mason jar seals which have since degraded past usability this potholder does not use rubber mason jar rings and instead uses a length of chains in a ring gauge is not important for this pattern it is more important that you can create a sturdy fabric with few gaps or holes if making the potholder with three colors you will need approximately 20 yards of your two primary colors the outer rings and 10 yards of your secondary color the inner ring and border the potholder is constructed as 9 separate components and joined together at the end"
