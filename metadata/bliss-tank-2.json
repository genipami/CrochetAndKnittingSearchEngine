  "notes": "this tank is a way for me to give back to you, my friends. the community i didn’t know i needed- thank you. \r\n\r\ni am so overwhelmed with how this art has connected me with people i truly cannot imagine my life without. i am so thankful for you.\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy this pattern!\r\n\r\ni also wrote this pattern to help spread awareness about [size inclusive collective][1]- a wonderful resource (for people of all sizes) to help promote grading advocacy in our industry so that *every body* can have access to well written, great fitting patterns.\r\n\r\nplease note financial inclusivity is just as important as size inclusivity. www.yarnsub.com is a great resource for a wide range of substitutes to fit any budget! honestly, anything lofty with lots of fuzz or bloom will work fine for this pattern- just swatch and see!\r\n\r\n\r\nintended to be worn with 1-3”/2.5-7.5” negative ease. modeled with 1”/2.5 cm negative ease. \r\n\r\nfront and back are knit flat, joined at the shoulders with a three-needle bind off, then seamed at the sides. neckline and optional armhole finishing are picked up and knit in the round.\r\n\r\nbody is shaped with a subtle a-line to skim the hips gently while also not creating too much fabric for tucking.\r\n\r\nnote: to convert majority of tank to the round, simply cast on 4 less than the cast on for front + back, & bind off 2 less at each underarm for initial bind off.\r\n\r\nif you love this pattern and my work, please consider supporting my work by checking out my other paid patterns, and/or leaving some comments on my instagram page!\r\n\r\n[danish translation here][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.instagram.com/sizeinclusivecollective/\r\n  [2]: https://strikkeglad.dk/52733/min-yndlingstop/",
