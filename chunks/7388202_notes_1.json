    "content": "the bear squish is possibly the most requested animal of them all - and whether it s a teddy bear squish or polar bear squish just depends on the colors of bernat blanket you choose this cuddly cutie is perfect for gifting working up quick with fuzzy and super bulky yarn as always i chose to make the bear squish with bernat blanket for a super cozy and cuddly teddy bear you can whip up in a weekend i used what i had on hand which means i made a polar bear squish but if you are looking for a teddy bear squish just switch out the colors i recommend taupe for color a and sand for color b or go bold with jewel tones neons - that s the joy of making it yourself"
