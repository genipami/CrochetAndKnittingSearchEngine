  "notes": "unlike a moss stitch square crocheted in-the-round, this turned-rounds design creates truly squared corners by correcting the bias that causes the swirly curvy shape. this method also makes a reversible cloth, not one that *almost* looks the same on both sides. gauge is unimportant, just do rounds until your desired size is reached.
