    "content": "your knitted square to fit although it may involve buying several different size cushion pads put the cushion pad diagonally on your knitting and its points should reach the middle of the knitted square i know why didn t i just say that in the first place 2 getting started that s enough maths let s get on with the actual knitting if you have knitted my ten stitch blanket you might want to skip the next few pages as it s basically the same things you need to know throughout this pattern i refer to ridges rather than row \ufffd a ridge in garter stitch is two knit row where possible all outside first stitches are slipped knitwise to \ufffd help with the joining i haven t put this in the instructions so as to simplify them and it s not disastrous if you forget the ten stitch strip being knitted is joined on to the body of the \ufffd knitting as you go along thus avoiding any sewing up this is done by working joining ridges like this k9 slip next stitch knitwise pick up and knit one stitch from the edge of the next ridge on the knitting or just in from the edge pass the slipped stitch over now turn and knit all 10 stitches to complete the ridge shaping is achieved by working short row/ridges knit the \ufffd specified number of stitches then wrap the following stitch turn the work and knit back this wrapping and turning will be abbreviated as w&t in the pattern and is worked like this 3 bring the yarn forward slip the next stitch purlwise take the yarn back again replace the slipped stitch on the left hand needle bring the yarn forward again and turn the work because of all the turning it s best to knit use short needles as \ufffd your knitting grows you ll find that you won t need to turn the whole thing so the process is smoother begin with a square \u2026 using the long tail method cast on 10 stitches knit 9 ridges 18 row garter stitch is a square stitch that is to say one ridge = one stitch so a 10 stitch square should consist of 10 ridges 20 row but you only work 9 ridges here as the cast on edge counts as the first ridge double corner this is made up of four steps refer to the notes above for how to work the short ridges and remember - each ridge is two row step 1 ridge 1 k9 w&t k9 ridge 2 k8 w&t k8 ridge 3 k7 w&t k7 ridge 4 k6 w&t k6 ridge 5 k5 w&t k5 ridge 6 k4 w&t k4 ridge 7 k3 w&t k3 ridge 8 k2 w&t k2 ridge 9 k1 w&t k1 4 even if you are slipping the first stitch of every ridge as i did knit that stitch on ridge 9 when you are only working on"
