    "content": "a quick and easy baby blanket for the minimalist knitter and gift receiver this blanket knits up fast and looks beautiful is easy enough to do while watching tv and will be well received as it is machine washable because in reality who wants a baby blanket you can t throw in with a load of dirty baby clothes perfect for multihue yarns - allowing for the beauty of the color complexion to not be overwhelmed or lost in a detailed pattern note i used 3 skeins of yarn and had about a yard of yarn leftover i would recommend buying 4 skeins for newborn size/5 for infant size in case you want to make the blanket longer or knit loser than i do i m a tight knitter"
