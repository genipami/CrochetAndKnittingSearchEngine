  "notes": "> this pattern is available for **[free on\r\n> my blog here][1]**. the downloadable pdf listed\r\n> for sale contains the full pattern\r\n> (including important notes, stitch\r\n> guide, written instructions and\r\n> charts), in one printable file without advertisements. in all languages except of arabic.\r\n\r\ngrinda shawl design was inspired by a boat trip to stockholm archipelago. the mal (make-a-long) consists of 5 parts. each celebrating the love for the sea and wild nature of a small grinda island.\r\n\r\ngrinda shawl uses one cake of whirl or woolly whirl yarn by scheepjes. depending on the gauge and personal crochet style more yarn can be required to complete the shawl. to be on the safe side it is recommended to add one cake of whirlette yarn in matching color. leftovers can be used for a shawl extension (given in the pattern) or a fringe. solid version of grinda shawl uses three cakes of whirlette.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is written in us and uk crochet terms and contains full written instructions and charts. the pattern is available in english, dutch, portuguese, swedish, german, norwegian, arabic, czech, french and spanish. \r\n\r\n**size:** the size of your finished shawl will depend on the yarn and hook you use, and on your personal gauge. my shawl is approx. 180cm/70.8” wide across and approx. 85cm/33.5” high.\r\nextended version is 208cm/81.8” wide and 95cm/37.4” high.\r\n\r\n**materials:**\r\n\r\n~ whirl or woolly whirl yarn by scheepjes – 1 cake. (225g/7.94 oz., 1000m/1094 yds) you might need one additional cake of whirlette yarn if you gauge is a little bit off.\r\n~ 3mm/3.25mm crochet hook (or the size needed to obtain correct gauge), scissors, tapestry needle to weave in tails.\r\n\r\n**gauge:** after row 6 the triangle is approx. 5cm/2in high.\r\n\r\n **errata** \r\n\r\n~ extension after part 4, *next row* stitch count should be: 148 dc and 147 ch1-sps on each sides, ch2-sp in the corner. new files uploaded on july 24th.\r\n\r\n~ part 4, chart. row 64 was corrected. new files uploaded on july 24th.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nmal schedule:\r\n\r\n[june 20th, 2018 - sneak peeks][2]\r\n[june 27th, 2018 - general infromation and full reveal][3]\r\njuly 11th, 2018 - [part 1][4]\r\njuly 18th, 2018 - [part 2][5]\r\njuly 25th, 2018 - [part 3][6]\r\n[august 1st, 2018 - part 4][7]\r\n[august 8th, 2018 - part 5][8]\r\n\r\ngrinda mal will be hosted in my [ravelry group here][9].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.lillabjorncrochet.com/2018/06/grinda-mal-general-information.html\r\n  [2]: https://www.lillabjorncrochet.com/2018/06/grinda-mal-coming-soon.html\r\n  [3]: https://www.lillabjorncrochet.com/2018/06/grinda-mal-general-information.html\r\n  [4]: https://www.lillabjorncrochet.com/2018/07/grinda-mal-part-1-english-us.html\r\n  [5]: https://www.lillabjorncrochet.com/2018/07/grinda-mal-part-2-english-us.html\r\n  [6]: https://www.lillabjorncrochet.com/2018/07/grinda-mal-part-3-english-us.html\r\n  [7]: https://www.lillabjorncrochet.com/2018/08/grinda-mal-part-4-english-us.html\r\n  [8]: https://www.lillabjorncrochet.com/2018/08/grinda-mal-part-5-english-us.html\r\n  [9]: https://www.ravelry.com/groups/lilla-bjorn-crochet"
