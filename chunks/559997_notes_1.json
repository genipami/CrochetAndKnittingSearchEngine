    "content": "this pattern is really a recipe for a basic asymmetrical scarf it starts with a few stitches and gradually grows with simple increases to create a boomerang style scarf i designed this pattern to use some of my hand-dyed hand-spun yarn the pattern will work for any yarn i recommend fingering to dk weight yarn this would be perfect for a beautiful skein of special yarn size 3 5-4mm needles work well for fingering weight yarn the stitch pattern can easily be modified i recommend some garter sections to keep the scarf from curling it could also be knit with all garter stitch but the simple stitch pattern keeps the knitting interesting and it is easily memorized thanks to my mother and sister for test knitting i am asked questions about this pattern recipe and since it only starts out with a few stitches my suggestion is usually to just start knitting it and see what happens it is easier than it seems and only takes a few minutes to figure out the pattern"
