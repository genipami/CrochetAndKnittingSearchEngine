    "content": "this is a simple lace bag that is perfectly suited for a standard-sized deck of tarot cards this pattern works best in a solid or semi-solid yarn that will show off the lace pattern however if you ve got a yarn that just speaks to you and you want to use it go for it you know what s going to work best for your decks so trust your intuition and choose a yarn that you love you ll want a small length of ribbon to use as a drawstring for this bag optional embellishments could include crystals or beads"
