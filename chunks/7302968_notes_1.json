    "content": "the colors i used for this original hat reminded me of a red velvet cake but would definitely look good in any color the pattern is super flexible too it s written for weight #3 yarn but sizing is based on your measurements as long as you have a multiple of 6 for your stitch count this pattern uses the spike stitch it is explained in the pattern but there are plenty of video tutorials floating around if you need a better explanation"
