    "content": "frankie s knitted stuff ten stitch hat this simple hat is based on my ten stitch twist pattern and is easy to knit once you get into it it would be a good introduction to the bigger round blanket pattern my finished hat is a large adult size but the pattern could be adapted to fit smaller heads with a certain amount of experimentation yarn and needles i used king cole bramble dk 290 m / 100g shade 4491 earth for my hat and 3 25 mm needles us size 3 the hat is knitted in garter stitch throughout and a strip of ten stitches measures about 4 5 cm / 1\u00be wide this weight of yarn and gauge will give you a hat with a 54 cm / 21 circumference unstretched when laid flat it measures about 24 cm / 9\u00bd from top to bottom but i turned up the brim which reduces that measurement by about 5 cm / 2 the hat could easily be made shorter i ll explain how later my hat used less than 80g of yarn so you can knit one from a single 100g ball there are several techniques that may be unfamiliar in this pattern on the following page i ll explain all these in detail don t worry if they seem confusing refer back to them when you get started and hopefully they will make sense then 1 things you need to know throughout this pattern i refer to ridges rather than row a \ufffd ridge in garter stitch is two knit row where possible all outside first stitches are slipped knitwise to \ufffd help with the joining i haven t put this in the instructions so as to simplify them and it s not disastrous if you forget the ten stitch strip being knitted is joined on to the body of the \ufffd knitting as you go along thus avoiding any sewing up this is done by working joining ridges like this k9 slip next stitch knitwise pick up and knit one stitch from the edge of the next ridge on the knitting or just in from the edge pass the slipped stitch over now turn and knit all 10 stitches to complete the ridge shaping is achieved by working short row / ridges knit the \ufffd specified number of stitches then wrap the following stitch turn the work and knit back this wrapping and turning will be abbreviated as w&t in the pattern and is worked like this bring the yarn forward slip the next stitch purlwise take the yarn back again replace the slipped stitch on the left hand needle bring the yarn forward again and turn the work because of all the turning it s best to knit the hat on short \ufffd needles to begin \u2026 using the long tail method cast on 10 stitches leaving enough of a tail to sew a short seam ridge 1 k2 w&t k2 ridge 2 k4 w&t k4 ridge"
