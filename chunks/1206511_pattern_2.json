    "content": "same stitches in reverse order at the end of each row you must turn your work the first and last stitches in every row are treble stitches treble_crochet i prefer to crochet my triangle shawls this way because it reduces the gauge and the triangle s base is flat instead of pulling up but if you prefer to simplify your work or you like a slightly shaped shawl just substitute the first and last treble_crochet by double_crochet stitches instead 3 chains at the beginning of the row instead of 4 the stitch count is very very important in this pattern the stitch count is what makes everything fall into place and keeps the motif and the shape of the shawl so make sure to count your stitches and to check that the stitch count provided in every row is ok 3 the color changes are not provided in the pattern as you can make your changes anywhere you want you can choose to change every few row as i did on the step-by- step pictures and repeat colors or you can use a gradient cake instead be creative if you like the step-by-step pictures just choose any matching 11 colors you like and follow the color changes in the pictures diagrams for each row show the current row top line as well as the previous row bottom line just one half of the pattern plus the 2 chain in the middle repeated stitches are marked in a colored rectangle if you are crocheting the full version approx 1200m of yarn follow all the instructions below in order if you are using a cake yarn and want to do the reduced version you need to skip the seaweed section see details below every chain in this pattern counts as 1 stitch this means that if you read make one double_crochet in each st from the row below for instance you need to make one st on top of every single st and every single chain the same applies for skipped stitches any chain counts as a stitch to skip are we ready to start crocheting our shawl let s get to it base triangle initial ring/loop chain 4 join with slip_stitch on the 1st chain to make a loop 4 chain in a closed loop 1st row all stitches go into the initial ring/loop 4 chain counts as 1st treble_crochet 5 double_crochet ch2 middle 5 double_crochet 1 treble_crochet stitch count 1 treble_crochet + 5 double_crochet per side + 2 chain in the middle 2nd row chain 4 counts as 1st treble_crochet 2 double_crochet into 1st st 5 double_crochet 2 double_crochet 2 chain 2 double_crochet middle 5 double_crochet 2 double_crochet 1 treble_crochet into last st stitch count 1 treble_crochet + 9 double_crochet per side + 2 chain in the middle 4 3rd row chain 4 counts as 1st treble_crochet 1 chain 1 double_crochet into 1st st 1 chain skip 1 st *1 double_crochet 1 chain skip 1 st* repeat from * until"
