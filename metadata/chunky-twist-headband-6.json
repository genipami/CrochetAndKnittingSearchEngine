  "notes": "i made a batch of these headbands as stocking fillers last christmas. they were fun to make and knit up super quick, perfect for my last minute gift panic.\r\n\r\nthey use just one ball of yarn so great if you have a stash of chunky yarns to hand.\r\n\r\nthis is a photo tutorial, so probably best suited to someone who knows how to knit and feels comfortable freestyling their projects.\r\n\r\ni thought i would share it as it looks good when it is done and is a quick knit.",
