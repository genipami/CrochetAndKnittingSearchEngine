  "notes": "the grain headband features a textured slip-stitch pattern, that is really easy to work.\r\n\r\nthe headband is knitted flat with chunky yarn, making it a quick-to-knit project. you can knit this headband in a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nthe edges of the finished headband are seamed together forming a twist.\r\n\r\nit's a one-skein knitting project. the gauge is not really important for this project, and the pattern width/length are easily adjustable.\r\n\r\nenjoy!\r\n\r\n"
