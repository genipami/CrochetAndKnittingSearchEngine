  "notes": "this pattern was specifically written for the 400 yard skeins, so you can feel confident about not running out of yarn with the smaller skeins.  it’s easy to customize for more yardage by simply adding to any section.  i would just continue knitting the lace at the end with my extra yarn.  a fairly simple pattern with a nice slipped stitch edge.  sections broken up just enough to keep it from being too boring, but still good tv knitting.\r\n\r\ndk version can be found here: https://bit.ly/2owdpjc\r\n\r\nstitches needed:\r\nknit\r\npurl\r\nslip\r\nyarn over\r\nk2 together\r\n\r\nfollow me on facebook to find out about new patterns coming out and for discount coupon codes at https://www.facebook.com/finickycreations\r\n\r\nif you have any questions, feel free to contact me through ravelry. if you find any mistakes, or anything that seems unclear, please let me know so i can get them corrected asap. thank you!\r\n\r\na special thank you to cristina sasaki for doing the fantastic portuguese translation and to zuzana for the great czech translation!\r\n"
