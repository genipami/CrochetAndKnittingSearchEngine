  "notes": "this mystery knit-along will end up with a pair of socks on christmas eve. there will be a new part released each day in december (1-24). the idea is to use leftover yarns, mini-skeins, or an advent calendar worth of yarns to knit these. that said, you could also have a lovely pair of socks with a single yarn. if you choose that option, your best plan would be to use a solid, semi-solid, or tonal yarn. \r\n\r\n**materials**: approximately 100 gms of fingering weight sock yarn. \r\n\r\n**gauge:** 8 sts and 11 rnds = 1 inch\r\n\r\n**sizes:** 7 (8, 9, 10) inch circumference\r\n\r\nthis pattern is knit top down, with 12 parts per sock. as written, the 12 parts you will knit  are the cuff, 5 leg sections, the heel, 4 foot sections, and the toe. \r\n\r\n**note:** the two socks are different! you will get 12 parts for each sock. if you wish to knit identical socks, you can choose to knit days 1-12 or days 13-24.\r\n\r\nif you are a determined toe-up knitter, you can certainly adapt the pattern.\r\n\r\npattern will update **every day** from december 1 to december 24, with each additional part added on to the original pattern.\r\n\r\nmkal chatter will be found [here][1] in the [fgf: the socks group.][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/discuss/fgf-the-sock-group/topics/4384750\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/groups/fgf-the-sock-group"
