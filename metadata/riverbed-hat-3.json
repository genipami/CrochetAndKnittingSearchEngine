  "notes": "the riverbed hat is knit in the round from the bottom up with two strands of yarn held together – dk-weight merino wool and mohair. \r\n\r\nthe design features a simple cable rib stitch. the pattern is a 4-row repeat.\r\n\r\nthe crown decreases are done in the last 7 rounds, and the top of the hat has a gathered look.\r\n\r\nthe long-tail tubular cast-on is used for this hat, but it is optional."
