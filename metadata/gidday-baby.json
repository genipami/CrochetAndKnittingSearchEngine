  "notes": "gidday: australian colloquialism for hello. a warm greeting of affection.\r\n\r\ngidday baby is a superbly simple cardigan. a striped garter stitch circular yoke is accentuated with cute buttons and a stocking stitch body. \r\n\r\nthis cardigan is knit top down and seamlessly, with added attention paid to the simple details. the body is knit flat and the sleeves are knit in the round. simple yarn over increases, which can be worked as a feature or closed, are used to shape the yoke. \r\n\r\ngidday is perfect for accentuating those special yarns. \r\n\r\nthe sample garments have been knit in white gum wool 8ply which is an ethically farmed 100% merino. the story behind white gum wool can be seen [here][1]. this is a must watch  story for yarn lovers. \r\n\r\ngidday baby was originally released in april 2014 as part of a non-mystery kal.  read below for an explanation as to why...\r\n\r\na series of blog posts explore the different parts of the pattern and offer support to beginner knitters as well as those looking to polish their skills.\r\n[part one: before the knitting][2]\r\n[part two: the yoke][3]\r\n[knitting through the back of the loop and twisted loops][4]\r\n[part three: splitting and the body][5]\r\n[part four: the sleeves][6]\r\n\r\n       * * * * * * * ** * * * ** * ** * ** ** ** * ** * \r\n\r\nmystery kals (knit-a-longs) are pretty hot property at the moment. \r\n\r\nthey're all over the place on ravelry, instagram and all the knitty crafty interwebs hangouts. \r\n\r\nanyway, all these mystery kals got me thinking about a kal where you knew what you were going to be knitting, you knew exactly what you were going to end up with at the end of the kal but it was still a new unreleased pattern. and just like a mystery kal you were only given a wee part of the pattern each week. does that sound like fun? like something you'd like to be a part of?\r\n\r\ni thought it did, so i came up with this kal which is suitable for both beginner and experienced knitters alike. it is a chatty kal, where we will talk techniques, tips and all sorts of things. at the end you come out with some new ideas and techniques, as well as a cute wee baby cardigan. \r\nand everyone needs a cute wee baby cardie for gifting!\r\n\r\n**want larger sizes?** \r\n[gidday][7] is the full size range version of this pattern (15-30\" chest) \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2013/s3897704.htm\r\n  [2]: http://www.tikkiknits.com.au/4/post/2014/04/non-mystery-kal-part-one.html\r\n  [3]: http://www.tikkiknits.com.au/4/post/2014/04/non-mystery-kal-part-two.html\r\n  [4]: http://www.tikkiknits.com.au/4/post/2014/04/non-mystery-kal-knitting-through-the-back-of-the-loop-and-twisted-stitches.html\r\n  [5]: http://www.tikkiknits.com.au/4/post/2014/04/non-mystery-kal-part-three.html\r\n  [6]: http://www.tikkiknits.com.au/4/post/2014/04/non-mystery-kal-part-four.html\r\n  [7]: http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/gidday",
