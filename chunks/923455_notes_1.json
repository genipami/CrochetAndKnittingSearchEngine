    "content": "this corner to corner baby blanket starts at one corner and uses alternating color changes to create diagonal stripes carry the yarn between the contrast color and main color to reduce the number of ends to weave in i found it worked best to do this when working double crochets into the chains at the beginning of increase row and by holding the two strands together working and non-working for slipped stitches on the decreasing row alternatively you can fasten_off at the end of each color transition and attach the new color when indicated the border is worked last after the first border round the ribbed look is achieved by working in short row and slip stitching it to the blanket as you go"
