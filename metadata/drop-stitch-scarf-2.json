  "notes": "this scarf uses a horizontal drop stitch or seafoam pattern. it is fun and easy to make, and looks beautiful in a variegated yarn. it is well suited to yarns that are a little slippery or silky.\r\n\r\nafter wearing, my scarf (made with 273 yards of handmaiden lady godiva) is about 70 inches/178cm long, and 5 inches/13 cm wide along the length with the garter stitch ends about 7 inches/18 cm wide.\r\n\r\nit was quite a bit shorter and wider right off the needles, before it had a chance to drape. this stitch pattern will definitely open up and grow in length once you block your scarf and put it on.\r\n\r\n* sami kaplan has designed the [drop stitch hat with button-on earflaps][2] to match this scarf!  \r\n* jessica kropf has designed a lovely [drop stitch tam][3] to match as well.\r\n\r\nthis pattern has been graciously translated into the following languages:\r\n\r\n* [italian][4] by isabel\r\n* [french][5], by sophie l.\r\n* norwegian, by maj is no longer available\r\n* [german][6], by angela\r\n* [spanish][7], by tanya\r\n* [finnish][8], by salla\r\n* [dutch][9], by katia is only for invited guests of the blog\r\n\r\n\r\n  [2]: http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/drop-stitch-hat-with-button-on-ear-flaps\r\n  [3]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/drop-stitch-tam\r\n  [4]: https://christine.typepad.com/free_patterns/easy%20drop%20stitch%20scarf%20ita.pdf\r\n  [5]: https://christine.typepad.com/free_patterns/easy%20drop%20stitch%20scarf%20pattern%20%28fr%29.pdf\r\n  [6]: http://anleitungen.bestrickendes.de/2012/07/03/wellenmusterschal/\r\n  [7]: http://alfanhui14.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/traduccion-de-drop-stitch-scarf-pattern/\r\n  [8]: https://christine.typepad.com/free_patterns/helppo%20huiviohje%20langankiertoja%20pudottamalla.pdf\r\n  [9]: http://tucanasdream.blogspot.com/2010/10/drop-stitch-scarf-nederlandse-vertaling.html",
