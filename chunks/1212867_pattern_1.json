    "content": "the french canadian crochet beret by jennifer savoie i love berets wool felt yarn and even those made from old sweaters unfortunately store-bought berets and the few other crochet beret patterns i ve tried don t love me back i have an average adult head size 54 5 cm / 21 5 but i find the diameter of most beret styles too wide perhaps i don t wear berets correctly anyway i decided to take measurements to determine which size diameter i prefer this led me to writing down this adjustable pattern which is easy enough for a beginner and can be adjusted even smaller or larger to suit the wearer i wanted to use easily accessible and inexpensive bulky weight yarn i was recently gifted with two skeins of bernat wavelength one ball 204 m / 223 yds was plenty to create one large sized beret and the other ball made one small and one medium sized beret i also tried the pattern in various other bulky weight brands and in one of my favourite worsted weight yarns with the yarn doubled as you can see from the following picture the thickness of the yarn varies from brand to brand sizing this pattern includes three sizes \uf0b7 small 24 cm / 9 5 this size should fit a small child \uf0b7 medium 26 cm / 10 5 this size should fit a teen to small adult and me and \uf0b7 large 29 cm / 11 5 this size should fit an average adult these sizes are based on the diameter of the circle at its largest the noted sizes are also based on using bernat wavelength bulky yarn #5 and a 5mm hook the brand of bulky yarn you use could impact the finished size but you can adjust the size up or down by increasing or decreasing the number of row the key is to measure the diameter of the hat before starting the second part of the pattern gauge since this will depend on the thickness of your chosen yarn i recommend going by the diameter of your hat at its largest rather than gauge however if you use bernat wavelength the diameter of the circle should be about 7 5 m / 3 after round 3 supplies \uf0b7 1 ball of your favourite bulky weight #5 yarn keeping in mind the thickness of the yarn will impact the measurements i used 2 balls of bernat wavelength 204 m / 223 yds to make three berets 1 ball of bernat roving 109 m / 120 yds for one beret less than one ball of bernat velvet 288 m / 315 yds for two berets less than one ball of lion brand homespun 169 m / 185 yds to make one beret and approx one ball of loops and threads swirl pie worsted weight yarn doubled #4 459 m / 502 yds to make one beret \uf0b7 crochet hook 5 mm \uf0b7 stitch marker optional but recommended \uf0b7"
