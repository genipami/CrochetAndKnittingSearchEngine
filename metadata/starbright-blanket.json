  "notes": "from lucy’s website: \r\n\r\nthis is my starbright blanket, inspired by nostalgic memories of my childhood christmases. think foil wrapped chocolates, twinkling fairy lights, brightly coloured baubles and garlands. these festive brights are set against the deep blues of a starry night sky, creating a blanket full of winter magic.\r\n\r\nthe starbright square is crocheted in 7 rounds, and there are six different colours in each square. the seventh and final round incorporates the join-as-you-go method of attaching the squares and building the blanket in rows.\r\n\r\nin this tutorial i'm going to walk you through making a 7-round square - this can be measured and used to check your tension and sizing. i then explain in detail (with lots of photos) how to join your squares together using the join-as-you-go method. at the end of the tutorial, i've written out the basic pattern for you to make the squares so that you can copy/paste/print in a word document if you wish, and keep this for reference. \r\n\r\na reminder that if you buy the starbright yarn pack from wool warehouse, it includes a 12 page a4 printed pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
