  "notes": "this is a simple basket great for keeping your yarny supplies in, or anything else you would like! it goes super quick using super bulky yarn and a bigger size hook. this pattern is great for beginners, using only the single crochet stitch, the magic ring/magic loop, and easy increases.\r\n\r\n*yarn:* any super bulky weight yarn you would like! you will need about 125-200 yards, depending on your gauge and yarn. feel free to use any other weight also, the basket will be smaller (or larger) if you do.  \r\n\r\n*hook(s):* i used size j/10-6.00 mm crochet hook, but make sure to use one or two sizes smaller than the recommended hook that the yarn ball band recommends. this will ensure that your basket is stiff and sturdy enough to act like a basket.   \r\n\r\n*gauge:* 9 sts and 3 rounds over 4 inches in single crochet using size j/10-6.00 mm hook, or one to two hook sizes smaller than the recommended hook on your ball band. \r\nnote: the gauge does not matter much unless you would like your basket to be the exact same size as my sample, but it also will change how the basket acts (stiff or less stiff).\r\n\r\n*finished measurements:*\r\n10 inches across the top, and 3.5 inches tall.\r\n\r\nthe finished size will vary depending on gauge and yarn.\r\n ",
