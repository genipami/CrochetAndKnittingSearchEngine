  "notes": "inspired by the peaceful winter walks in the woods i love to take, alone or in good company, these socks have little flurries at the cuff and a simple meditative repeat on the leg and foot.  a quick cozy project in squishy dk yarn, to warm your feet as you stroll outdoors all winter long. \r\n\r\nthis is a top/cuff down sock.\r\n\r\nthe pattern is written for sizes s, m, l and xl (48, 52, 56, 60 stitches circumference) suggested measurements of the widest part of the foot: 8, 8.5, 9, 9.75 inches.\r\n\r\nyarn: 100 g dk weight yarn \r\nsample in tabby dk sock set, by alley cat yarns\r\ncolourway coast (100g main and 30g mini)\r\nalley cat yarns website: https://alleycatyarns.ca/collections\r\n\r\n* though this pattern is written for dk yarn, it has been tested with great results holding fingering yarn double.  we suggest using alley cat yarns smooth sock base for beautiful results.\r\n\r\nneedles: 3 mm long cable for magic loop\r\n\r\ngauge: 7 sts = 1 inch\r\n\r\nnotions: stitch marker, needle for grafting and scissors.\r\n\r\n",
