  "notes": "first i posted a moss stitch shawl pattern, then i posted a moss stitch in a square pattern, and i got lots of comments about how to use this same stitch but in a rectangle. well here it is! moss stitch in a rectangle using caron big cakes yarn! you get a lot of bang for your buck with this yarn. with just two balls, it makes a fairly good size blanket and i love all of the different variegated color combos available. the colors will naturally makes these stripes! just keep crocheting in rounds and see the yarn work its magic!\r\n\r\n**materials**:\r\n– 2 balls of caron big cakes yarn. i am using cherry cake.\r\n– size h crochet hook\r\n– tapestry needle\r\n– clover tassel maker (optional)\r\n\r\n**finished size**: approximately 30 x 36 inches"
