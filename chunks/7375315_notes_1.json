    "content": "i knit these beauties last year and promptly forgot to share the pattern oops once again i used the barnacle stitch pattern aka - mock cable stitch to jazz up a basic sock pattern because this stitch pattern features ribbing it is perfect for a nicely fitting sock also i dipped into my stash of laceweight yarns because - why not a light sock weight should also work if using sock yarn you ll need about 400 meters materials 2 balls of complementary laceweight yarns that have some nylon or silk in them for strength i used two balls of fiddlesticks knitting exquisite yarn i had in my stash 50% merino/50% silk each having 547 yards you could chose contrasting yarns i chose the same color as i wanted the stitch pattern to pop i estimate i used under 400 meters of each needles 2 25 mm double pointed needles customization this pattern is for a women s size 10 canadian to make a larger or small size change your number of stitches cast on by multiples of 4 25% of your stitches will be on needle #1 50% on needle #2 and 25% on needle #3 to be sure your sock will fit measure the circumference your foot around the fullest part and call this measurement a knit a swatch in stockinette to determine the number of stitches per inch take measurement a and multiply it by the number of stitches per inch then subtract 10% for example if measurement a is 9 inches and your stitches per inch is 8 9 x 8 = 72 sts to prevent having a sloppy sock subtract 10% of your stitches in this case 7 sts that leaves you with 65 sts for the pattern to work you need a stitch number divisible by 4 65 sts doesn t work but 64 does in this example i d cast on 64 stitches the stitch pattern in this sock has a good amount of stretch foot length can be altered by increasing the rounds knit this pattern is available for free on my blog link text 1 1 https //www theknittedraven com/2024/10/dainty-socks html#more"
