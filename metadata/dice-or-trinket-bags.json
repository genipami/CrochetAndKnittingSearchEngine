  "notes": "these small drawstring bags are about 5\" tall and 4\" across when laid flat. they are the perfect size to use as a dice bag, or to hold any trinkets or small items. \r\n\r\nthe pattern includes 3 different styles, each following the same pattern but using a different stitch in alternating rows. one uses rows of double crochet, another uses crossed double crochet, and the last uses the bead stitch.\r\n\r\nthe top has a row of chain spaces to create eyelets to thread the drawstring through. \r\n\r\n"
