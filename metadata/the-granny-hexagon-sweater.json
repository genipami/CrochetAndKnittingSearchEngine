  "notes": "hi everyone and welcome to the granny hexagon sweater! a super simple and fun garment which looks great in different colours and in just one colour. you can choose to go cropped or add a bit of extra length. this sweater is made up from 2 hexagons. it has around 5cm positive ease and it is made to measure so you can use any yarn and any hook. i have based the yarn yardage on aran/worsted weight but ultimately you can use any ply of yarn. i look forward to seeing everyone’s version of the granny hexagon sweater! please note that the larger sizes will have wider sleeves and will be a bit longer in length due to the way that the sweater is constructed.\r\n\r\nwritten in us terms                          advanced beginner\r\n\r\n"
