  "notes": "a detailed step-by-step recipe for basic gloves that fit perfectly - no matter the shape/size of your hand, or the yarn you want to use. including a special pick-up technique to avoid holes/gaps around the thumbs & fingers.\r\n\r\n**included in the pattern:**\r\n\r\n* pdf with altogether 15 pages\r\n* very detailed step-by-step written instructions\r\n* tons of pictures and helpful tips\r\n* video tutorials for all knitting techniques are available (on my blog)\r\n\r\n**difficulty:** intermediate\r\n\r\nthese gloves are knit in the round using double-pointed knitting needles. they don’t feature any complicated stitches and are very straightforward to knit. however, maintaining an even tension, especially as you add the thumbs/fingers can be quite tricky. the same applies to handling the small diameter fingers and working with multiple stitch holders.\r\napart from detailed tutorials for all involved techniques, the pattern lists every single step in great detail. there's even a full video knit-along available on top of that.\r\n\r\n**yarn and yardage:**\r\nthe sample is knit with a solid 4-ply sheep wool yarn that runs for 225 meters per 100 gram. as the instructions tell you exactly how to determine your cast-on requirements in case you are using a different yarn, you can finish it with any other yarn weight from lace to dk provided you are fine with doing some simple math.\r\n\r\n**skills required:**\r\nknit, purl, ssk, k2tog, picking up stitches\r\n\r\n**materials:**\r\n* < 100 grams of yarn. the recipe has been tested for yarn weights between lace and dk weight.\r\n* a set of 5 dpns (relatively small compared to the recommended size for your yarn weight)\r\n* tapestry needle\r\n* scissors\r\n* 3 stitch marker\r\n* scrap yarn, a spare cord, a bit of wire, etc to hold stitches\r\n* (optional) crochet hook for picking up stitches"
