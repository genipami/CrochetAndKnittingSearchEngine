    "content": "this pattern produces a round carpet with cables i used 1500 meters of cotton string 3 mm thick and a 5 mm crochet hook size h in the us to obtain a diameter of 110 cm 43 inches the pattern has 51 rounds and is a lot easier than it seems the whole work took me about 10 hours the carpet is worked in a spiral so as to avoid that ugly seam running from the center to the edge remember don t close any rounds with a slip_stitch you can use any yarn but remember one thing the crochet hook needs to be almost twice as thick as the yarn if you use a yarn of different thickness than my 3 mm cord then the diameter will change but i can t predict by how much this pattern has been first published in polish on my blog http //magiccarpetstudio blogspot com/2022/09/szydekowy-dywan-w-warkocze html if any of the photos in the pdf file seem too small you can find their bigger originals on my blog"
