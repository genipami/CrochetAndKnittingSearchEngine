  "notes": "i was inspired by the outlander tv series to create some more textured crochet items for my store. after making a few fingerless gloves, i took a stab at creating my own design. i came up with this pattern almost a year ago and finally decided to type it up and offer it for free. \r\n\r\nthese gloves use a 4.25mm hook and you will need to know bptc, fptc, sc, sl st"
