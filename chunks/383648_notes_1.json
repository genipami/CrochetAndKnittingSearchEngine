    "content": "this is a basic pattern for fingerless mittens / handwarmers / wrist warmers or whatever you want to call them using chunky / bulky yarn one pair will use just fractionally less than 50g so it s an easy and satisfying one skein project the wrist is worked in rib / ribbing and the hand and thumb are worked in stocking / stockinette stitch an alternative version is also given for the hand and thumb using reverse stocking / stockinette stitch this is a one-size pattern but it s easy to adapt if you want something a little longer or larger but be aware that you then may need more than one ball of yarn"
