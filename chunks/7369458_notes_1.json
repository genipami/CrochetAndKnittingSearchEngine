    "content": "crochet an apple airtag holder in **15 minutes** with this free easy pattern just **6 short rounds** it s great for using up **yarn scraps** **3 pattern options ** 1 basic holder without hanging loop 2 holder with built in mini loop 3 holder with separate loop sewn on any length more sturdy use any **dk or worsted weight** wool or acrylic etc **avoid cotton** because it s not elastic so your holder may be too tight at first and then too loose **smooth merino** works best because it looks neat and smooth like cotton instead of a rustic wool look but is nice and stretchy"
