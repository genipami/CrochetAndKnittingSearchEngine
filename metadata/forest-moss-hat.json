  "notes": "the forest moss hat is the perfect winter beanie. it is knit in 2×2 rib, and the brim is folded twice, making the hat extra-warm around the ears.\r\n\r\nthe hat is knit in the round from the bottom up with two strands of yarn held together – dk-weight merino wool and mohair. adding a strand of mohair creates a soft halo and makes the hat cozier and warmer.\r\n\r\nthe crown decreases are done in the last 7 rounds, and the top of the hat has a gathered look."
