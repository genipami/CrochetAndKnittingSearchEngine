  "notes": "crochet mesh bags are a classic, but nowadays these simple market / beach bags, seems to be a popular fashion accessories, as well. when i made my crochet market bag, i wanted that rustic feeling, and decided to use my springtime magic mandala to create a beautiful bottom for the bag and to use a cotton/linen blend yarn.  \r\n\r\nand here it is; my rustic market bag. hope you'll enjoy the pattern\r\n\r\nthe pdf-pattern is also updated with a foldable version in uk-terms, us-terms and norwegian\r\n\r\nnote: the swedish pattern is just for the bag, not the foldable version. \r\n\r\nthe pattern is also available for free in norwegian at [hverdagsmagi][1] \r\n\r\n if you prefer a pdf-file, or would like more pictures, you can buy the pattern in my ravelry store for $1. the pdf-download will include a us, uk, norwegian and swedish version.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.hverdagsmagi.com/2018/05/rustikk-handlenett.html"
