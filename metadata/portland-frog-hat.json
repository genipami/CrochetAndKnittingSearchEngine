  "notes": "this pattern was inspired by the portland frog, 2025\r\n\r\nhat is knit in the round with super bulky yarn. size can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing cast on by increments of 4 sts. \r\n\r\ninstructions are included for a worsted weight version, too.\r\n\r\na bit of felt and buttons are needed for the eyes.\r\n\r\nhow do you start a frog hat? rib it! rib it!"
