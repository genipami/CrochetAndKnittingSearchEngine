  "notes": "with my free knitted house pattern, you can knit tiny houses that are quick to make, very satisfying, and lots of fun. \r\n\r\neach house uses a small amount of yarn, so they are perfect for those leftover oddments that are too good to throw away but too small for a bigger project.\r\n\r\n**techniques used in free knitted house pattern**\r\nthese houses are worked in the round, but can be worked in a few different ways. all of them avoid seams and give a neat finish, especially around the roof and base.\r\n\r\n**level of difficulty and skills required**\r\nmy free knitted house pattern is an intermediate knitting pattern, because it is worked in the round, to avoid side seams. you begin each house from the bottom up, then add the door and windows with duplicate stitch (swiss darning), before closing the bottom seam with whip stitch.\r\n\r\n**materials**\r\n- oddments of 4ply cotton yarn (or sock yarn) in three different colours:\r\ncolour for main house.\r\ncolour for roof.\r\ncolour for door and windows.\r\n- 2 x stitch markers.\r\n- 2.5mm (us 2) knitting needles in style as preferred, for knitting in the round.\r\n- wool needle."
