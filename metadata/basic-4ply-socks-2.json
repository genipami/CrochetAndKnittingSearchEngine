  "notes": "the idea of knitting socks can be quite daunting if you've not done it before.  the whole thought of turning heels and grafting toes can be quite enough to put you off before you even pick up your needles - and i know this because that's how i felt too!\r\n\r\ni know there are many sock patterns and tutorials on the internet aimed at beginners, but sometimes you just need one basic pattern that you can use to get started, increase your confidence and then adapt to suit your own feet.  i'd like to share mine with you, altered over many pairs to get it just the way that i like to wear my socks, and still being adapted to suit other members of the family.  \r\n\r\nthe winwick mum sockalong step-by-step tutorial posts on the blog accompany this pattern. these tutorials are written for short circulars, dpns and long circular (magic loop) and cover everything from choosing yarn and needles to knitting your socks right down to the grafted toes - there's no excuse not to cast on!\r\n\r\njust one size is given in the pattern but you can find the sock stitch calculation in the tutorials to help you adjust it to any size of foot that you want to knit for.  \r\n\r\nnow available in italian with many thanks to laura lucia rossi \r\n[https://www.ravelry.com/people/laluandtheseasons][1]\r\n[https://www.instagram.com/lalu_and_the_seasons][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n**kind words**\r\n\r\n*\"i’m so proud! i absolutely loved making these, fabulous pattern, it came highly recommended and did not disappoint and can’t wait to make more! thanks again!\"  rachel @thefrenchseams, instagram*\r\n\r\n*\"i just love making socks with winwick mums basic sock pattern. it is so much a part of me. i make a pair and immediately start another one. it is the best, it makes a day, and keeps me happy. love giving them away because i feel it comes from a part of my life to them.\"  veronica, facebook*\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/people/laluandtheseasons\r\n  [2]: https://www.instagram.com/lalu_and_the_seasons/"
