    "content": "this crochet slouchy hat is the easiest pattern you ll find not only does it use basic stitches that are easy for the entry-level crocheter but it uses a bulky weight yarn that works up in a snap this pattern takes me about 30 minutes to crochet even for a new crocheter it should only take about an hour to make note if you don t have any bulky weight yarn on hand you can hold together 2 strands of worsted weight yarn and follow the pattern as written to achieve a similar look/fit"
