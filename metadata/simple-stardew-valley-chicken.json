  "notes": "a simple chicken from stardew valley! \r\n\r\nhooks and yarn are merely a suggestion-- find whatever gives a nice tight fabric that doesn't allow polyfill leak out. you can also make a pouch and fill it with poly beads and put that in the base of the chicken before filling. it gives the chicken a *very* satisfying heft. \r\n\r\nwith the bernat blanket yarn one chicken is about 100g. if you're lucky you can get about three chickens from 1 skein. \r\n\r\nultimately, this a basically a basket that is seamed, but many people asked for the pattern, so here it is. \r\n\r\nthis is my first pattern i've drafted, so if you find issues, please feel free to message me and i'll try to update/fix it as best i can.
