    "content": "such as would be needed for a very tall greyhound or borzoi take note of how many additional row you require based on your row gauge ensuring you have sufficient yarn increase by 6 sts as follows k12 kfb 6 times - 84 sts work in stocking stitch/stockinette for another 10cm 20cm from cast-on edge please note that this is the measurement i use for the shop snoods you may wish to alter this to suit your dog increase by 6 sts as follows k13 kfb 6 times - 90 sts shoulders continuing with mc work in garter stitch until the overall length from cast on is appx 23cm 9 depending on height of your hound plus remaining yarn cast-off bind-off which will require at least 2 metres notes and variations wanting to make some changes to better suit your needs try these so that each snood you make is as unique as your hound if you wish to work flat on straight needles by all means do so but bear in mind that a thick seam may be uncomfortable on your dog any alteration to the width/girth should be made in multiples of 6 sts to suit the k3 p3 rib please note that i cannot help you with altering sizes to suit yours or any other dog breeds you will need to work that out for yourself upper may also be worked in garter or moss seed stitch but will not have the snug fit shown adding a few centimetres/inches will allow a much longer section for either turning over or enough to cover the dogs ears which might assist to muffle the sound of thunderstorms or other loud noise that may distress your dog this may require an additional ball of yarn centre can have additional rounds added work in stripes of varying widths or colour block by working in a second colour work from a single skein such as a gradient or self-striping yarn that is a good contrast to the mc consider using fingering-weight 4 ply yarn held doubled i use my sock leftovers for this purpose shoulders can be worked in a k3 p3 ribbing or moss seed stitch of k1 p1 on the first round and then p1 k1 on the second weave in all ends paying particular attention to the upper as the wrong side will be seen when turned over block and enjoy watching your hound strut around mine certainly loves an audience if your dog wears a collar for walking then i suggest that the snood sits lower on the shoulders however if using a harness where the leash attaches across the dogs back it is unlikely to interfere there is no leash gap in the pattern for the very reason that everyone has a slightly different set up for walking their dog and what might suit my requirements is rather different for someone else i d love to see your project on ravelry please use tags #ginniesimplesnood #ginnieglam #ginniegear"
