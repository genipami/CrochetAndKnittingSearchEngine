  "notes": "this is a simple pattern, great for crocheters with an intermediate skill level. these gloves work up in just a few hours.\r\n\r\ni used one skein of sirdar snuggly dk yarn to complete both gloves, though any dk yarn should be fine. i have also used lion brand mandala yarn for these. i did not gauge this pattern. this pattern has been tested. \r\n\r\nit's ok to sell products created from this pattern, i just ask that you include a link back to it.",
