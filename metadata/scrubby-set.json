  "notes": "doing the dishes is never a fun task, especially when you find yourself using a dingy sponge that has an overused metallic smell. you know exactly what i’m talking about! thanks to red heart scrubby yarn, i’ve thrown every last kitchen sponge away and i will never waste a single penny on another.\r\n\r\ni’m all about crocheting practical things and this crochet scrubby set tops the list. scrubby yarn serves its purpose very well. the fiber content is 100% polyester making it dry much quicker than cotton or acrylics. this allows your scrubbies to dry much faster and cuts down on mold and the odor it causes. win win!\r\n\r\nif you haven’t seen it already, check out my yarn review for red heart scrubby. i think you’ll fall in love with it too! my biggest piece of advice when working with this yarn is to not be afraid. it’s much easier to work with than you make think (if using the proper pattern) and if you make a mistake, it’s the most forgiving yarn i’ve ever worked with.  follow along with my tutorial below and you’ll see just how fun making dish scrubbies can be!"
