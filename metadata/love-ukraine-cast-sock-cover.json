  "notes": "this pattern is for cast sock covers. it is intended to keep the person who has a cast on their leg warm, therefore i recommend using thick wool or thick wool blend. at the moment button-up cast covers are desperately needed by injured ukrainian soldiers. many knitters are making warm items to donate to the ukrainian army, as at this moment warm knits are super, super needed there, winters there are harsh. \r\n\r\n\r\nhere you can read about why this pattern is here, why it matters and why it is saving lives (in english):\r\nhttps://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/society/another-knitting-campaign-for-ukraine-soldiers-launched-in-latvia.a483460/\r\n\r\nand (in latvian): \r\nhttps://www.lsm.lv/raksts/zinas/latvija/aicina-adit-attaisamus-adijumus-ukrainas-ievainotajiem.a484361/\r\n\r\n\r\nmany thanks to daiga valkovska for sharing her knowledge regarding the sizing for these cast cover button-up socks! here is her video (in latvian) regarding the sizing: \r\nhttps://youtu.be/p1u7djhsw0k\r\n\r\n\r\ni have done my best to create an easy-to-read, easy-to-follow, row-by-row knitting pattern. if there is a stitch or a technique you are not familiar with, please look it up on youtube. i have provided some links, but please look up other videos if you need more help. \r\nthe pattern is row by row, but i have also provided measurements in case your row gauge is slightly different. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\napraksts ir pieejams gan latviešu, gan angļu valodās.
