    "content": "crochet pattern pen holder bookmark this pattern is a great stash-buster and can be made with any combination of yarns that essentially equal a worsted weight for example hold two strands of yarn together to provide a fun effect one solid or semi-solid color dk weight and one variegated color fingering weight like the photo below the pattern shared here uses worsted weight yarn materials 30 yards of worsted weight yarn 4 0mm hook yarn needle sewing thread sewing needle stitches used chain chain half_double_crochet half_double_crochet half_double_crochet blo half_double_crochet in the back loops only note the pen holder is crocheted as one long piece beginning with the back portion with a turning point using blo when it is time to start creating the front portion so for a 6 x 8- inch notebook it is essentially 26 row of half_double_crochet then 1 row of blo half_double_crochet then 22 row of half_double_crochet adjust the length of your piece to fit the length of your notebook before you make the blo half_double_crochet instructions for a 6 x 8 notebook using worsted weight yarn chain 7 row 1 half_double_crochet in the 2nd chain from hook and across turn 6 row 2 chain 1 half_double_crochet across turn 6 row 3 26 repeat row 2 essentially you repeat row 2 until your piece measures the length of your notebook i e if you are making your pen holder for a 6 x 8-inch notebook then the piece should measure 8 inches long without stretching before moving on to the next step for me that is 26 row of half_double_crochet but feel free to modify the number of row if your gauge is different than mine or if your notebook is longer than 8 inches after your piece measures the length of your desired notebook row 27 ch1 half_double_crochet into the blo turn 6 this creates a turning point of sorts so that you can begin the front part of the cover next do not fasten_off still working on the same piece you will now begin the front part of the pen cover row 1 ch1 half_double_crochet across turn 6 row 2 - 22 repeat row 1 until your piece measures 1-inch shy of the back portion of the pen holder for example if your pen holder is for an 8-inch notebook the back portion of the holder should measure 8-inches as noted in the first half of this pattern and the front portion should measure 7-inches fasten_off leaving a long end to sew one side of the pen holder together thread a yarn needle with the long end weave the yarn in and out of the stitches along one side of the pen holder to sew the long side together fasten_off and weave in end with another length of yarn again thread the yarn needle and sew up the other long side of the pen holder the pen holder itself is now complete now you will add elastic to the back of it to fit"
