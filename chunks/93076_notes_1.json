    "content": "this simple & beautiful cowl is knit in the round using less than one skein of malabrigo this would also look great in a gradient or variegated yarn it is easy to customize the circumference and height of this cowl to your preference simply add or subtract stitches in multiples of 4 or add repeats the pattern suggests to bind off loosely some knitters have found they enjoyed using jeny s surprisingly stretchy bind off 1 binding off in the k2p2 pattern also leaves a nice finished edge 1 http //www youtube com/watch v=53mtbkyf5cq"
