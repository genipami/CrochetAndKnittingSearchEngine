  "notes": "this soft and light wrap will curl around you like a fern frond. \r\n\r\nyou will need only one ball of beautiful pittura yarn, or any similar fingering yarn, to make this unusual, asymmetric wrap.  \r\n\r\nalternating ‘solid’ and lace rows makes this a quick and fun project.  \r\n\r\nthis pattern was completely revised and a us version added on 30 march 2020.\r\n\r\n**please note that the main stitch used in this pattern is the treble (uk double treble).\r\nthis is the tall stitch which begins with yarn over hook twice.****\r\n"
