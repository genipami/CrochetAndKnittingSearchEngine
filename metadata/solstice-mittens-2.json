  "notes": "in the depths of winter, around the shortest day of the year, the sun appears to rise and set in the same place for several days in a row - hence the word, solstice, (sun-stands-still).  this gave me the idea for the name, as the colourwork in these mittens reminded me of little suns. \r\n\r\n\r\nthis fingerless mitten features rolled hems, a colorwork band at the wrist, and comes in 1 size. \r\n\r\nthis is a great stash buster for small left-overs, using only 20g of the main color and under a meter of the contrast color.\r\nthey knit up really quickly, and would be a great gift for someone.\r\n \r\n\r\n**important notes**\r\nthe colorwork should be a bouncy tension, enough to fit over your hand, but not too loose.\r\n i used the traditional knitted cast-on and cast-off in the pattern because i like how the edge looks. but if you'd like a stretchier edge, feel free to use another method. \r\n\r\nyou can customize as well by add ribbing, or adding a top to make a complete mitten. \r\n\r\n**finished measurements**\r\ncircumference: to fit average adult hand of 8.65\"\r\n\r\n**yarn**\r\n* 20g (99 meters or 108 yards) of main color biches & bûches le petit lambswool in bonbon.\r\n* 0.14g (0.69 meters or 0.76 yards) of contrasting color, jamieson's of shetland shetland spindrift in color moorit (108).\r\n\r\n**gauge**\r\n14 sts x 19 rnds = 2\" or 4 cm, on 2.5 mm needles.\r\n\r\n**needles**\r\n2.5 mm & 2.75 mm dps (sets of 4 needles)\r\n\r\n**notions**\r\nslim stitch markers\r\nwaste yarn\r\ndarning needle\r\n",
