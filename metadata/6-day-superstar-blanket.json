  "notes": "this variation of the classic 6-day kid blanket works from the center out into the shape of a fourteen-pointed star. no one can make just one 6-day blanket, star blanket, or superstar blanket, and with so many choices you will never get bored.this pattern is adaptable. the blanket can be made in virtually any yarn and you can continue to grow it as big as you want it.approximate yardage for 2 common sizes and weights:for dk or #3 weight yarn you will need approximately 1200 yards for a 40 baby blanket and 2000 yards for a 60 throw-sized blanket.for worsted or #4 weight yarn you will need approximately 1000 yards for a 40 baby blanket and 2400 yards for a 60 throw-sized blanket.hooks: test crocheters have found that we needed a much larger hook than we would normally use to avoid curling. most worked the #3 weight with an h or 5 mm hook, and the worsted with a k or 6.5 mm hook."
