  "notes": "learn how to crochet a corner to corner moss stitch rectangular blanket complete with its very own moss stitch border! \r\n\r\nfor my blanket i used 2 and a half cinnamon swirl cakes in the colourway \"tropical breeze\" with a 6mm hook \r\n\r\nfor the border i used 2 balls of paintbox chunky in white with a 7mm hook. \r\n\r\nmy blanket measures approximately 90cm x 106cm (35\" by 41\")\r\n\r\nyou can use any yarn you so wish, please note - you will need a hook size at least one size larger than the yarn recommends and a hook two sizes larger for the border."
