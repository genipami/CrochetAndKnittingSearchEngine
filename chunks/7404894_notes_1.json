    "content": "this quiver full of arrows scarf makes a wonderful gift as it represents of all the children in a family you can make this scarf to show off a different color for one child or ten in this first pattern you will choose one main color and then a different color for each person represented in the scarf this scarf idea came from my talented crochet friend christine and is based on psalm 127 4-5 which says like arrows in the hands of a warrior are children born in one s youth blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them"
