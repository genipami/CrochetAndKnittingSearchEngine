    "content": "**description** relatively simple recipe for bruges-style lace with a ribbon pattern curling around flower motifs there are some special instructions for starting and ending nicely the middle part where you ll spend most of your time is repetitive and not too hard to memorize the lace is quite stretchy if worked without a border ideas for adding a simple border are included which would decrease stretchiness and provide a flat edge to attach the lace to another project the lace can be worked flat or joined in a loop **stash busting** the flowers are worked separately and don t take much yarn so they could be used as a stash-buster for leftover bits from other projects **sizing** in principle this piece can be worked in any gauge the width of the lace is approximately the length of 30 single crochets it can be made as long as desired **notions** for the looped variant it is helpful to have a few locking stitch markers on hand **acknowledgements** i wrote this pattern after failing to replicate this one 1 if you like that one better instructions in english can be found on the blog post 2 linked to that ravelry page 1 https //www ravelry com/patterns/library/les-fleurs-3 2 https //turningleavesstudio blogspot com/2021/02/playing-with-string-solving-puzzles html"
