  "notes": "toe up? top down? undecided? no matter your sock knitting preference, this pattern is for you. great for beginners, this basic sock pattern has multiple sizes for everyone on your list and instructions for both knitting from the toe up as well as from the cuff down included. grab a pretty skein of sock yarn and, as fleetwood mac says, you can go your own way.\r\n\r\nwhile this pattern is beginner basic pattern, you should be comfortable with knitting in the round with dpns, 2 circulars or magic loop. other techniques used are judy's magic cast on, short rows (toe up version) and kitchener stitch (cuff down version). instructions and links are included in the pattern for these techniques.\r\n\r\nthis pattern was written with a 5.5” leg length but you can make it shorter or longer; however if you do the latter you may need an additional skein of yarn.\r\n\r\nupdate 5/12\r\nsmall typo on the heel flap of the toe up version:\r\nrow 1 (rs): k 32 (35, 41, 44, **47**) sts, picking up remaining wraps, ssk, turn. 1 st dec\r\nrow 2 (ws): [sl1, p1] rep 10 (11, 13, 14, 15) times, **sl1**, p2tog, turn. 1 st dec.\r\n\r\n",
