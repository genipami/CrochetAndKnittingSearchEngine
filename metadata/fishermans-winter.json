  "notes": "‘fisherman’s winter’ is my take on the classic fisherman rib beanie hat. it has incredible stretch and is seamed at the crown so it fits to the top of the head with no gather. the pattern includes instructions for 3 yarn weights, each in 4 sizes.\n  \nskills used\nthis pattern uses mainly slip stitches and chains. you will need to work increases, decreases, keep careful count of your stitches and sew together the crown and side seam to finish the hat.\nthe pattern includes a photo guide, joining schematic and a link to a left and right video tutorial which takes you through some of the potentially challenging areas of the pattern.\n  \nmaterials\nthe pdf is written out separately for 3 yarn weights, each requiring a different amount of yarn depending on size made:\n4ply / fingering: 210-370m, 4mm crochet hook\ndouble knit: 170 - 290m, 4.5mm crochet hook\naran / worsted weight: 140 - 240m, 5.5mm crochet hook\ndetails of recommended hook size and meterage by yarn weight and size are given in the pattern\n  \nsizing\nthe pattern is written in 4 sizes; toddler, child, adult and large adult, to fit head 40-45cm, 45-50cm. 50/55cm, 55-60cm.\nthe hat is worked with a lot of negative ease so will be smaller than the head it is designed to fit.\nmore detailed measurements are given in the pattern along with guidance on how to alter the length of the hat.\n  \nnote that the adult 4ply version of this patter is available for free on the dora does website. here you are purchasing the premium add free pdf which includes all variations and a photo guide\n  \ncopyright dora does 2021. the pattern is for personal use and may not be reproduced or shared without written consent. you may sell what you make from my pattern, but please credit me as the designer with a link to the pattern page."
