    "content": "a quick and fun beaded bracelet pattern based on an easy new technique called forward loop chain video tutorial included forward loop chains give stability and texture to this fully reversible bracelet bracelets can be worn singly stacked or even twisted together for maximum impact a light cotton dk was used for samples but winding lane can be made with any cotton thread and the appropriate size hook if using smaller thread choose a smaller bead size thanks for viewing and happy crocheting"
