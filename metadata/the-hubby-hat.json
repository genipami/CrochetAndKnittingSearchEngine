  "notes": "a simple double layer hat to please the picky husband guy.\r\n\r\nhubby hat. you know the type. no color. no cables. no nothing. with this simple double layer hat you can try to insert some excitement and color to hubby’s wardrobe. take a colorful skein of some tickly and prickly wool and one colorless skein of smooth merino goodness. he’ll feel the difference and be forced to wear his hat the colorful side up.\r\n\r\na finnish version can be found on the [blog][1].\r\n\r\n\r\nerrata: the first version of the pattern didn't state that the knitted sts between the decreases get fewer by the rounds. this is now fixed in the pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://missaneuloimmekerran.blogspot.fi/2015/11/miespipo.html",
