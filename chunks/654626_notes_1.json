    "content": "a sock inspired by classic fishermen ganseys apart from the main patterns this design also tries to emulate the way the underarm gussets are shaped on close fitting sweaters to give a slighly different look to the gussets on the foot this is essentially a fairly simple sock that would lend itself to be adapted with many other classic gansey patterns"
