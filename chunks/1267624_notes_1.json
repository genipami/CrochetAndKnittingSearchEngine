    "content": "this is a great stashbusting project it does not require much yarn and the pattern is flexible enough to use any size yarn to get a good result you can choose any color and variegated or speckled yarns are also a great choice for a unique look you can even try a striped version by changing colors every few row materials & tools 60g approx of super bulky yarn of your choice sample made in malabrigo rasta small amount of brown yarn for stem craft/pillow stuffing 9 mm crochet hook / 4 mm crochet hook tapestry needle for sewing and weaving in ends scissors you will need to know these techniques and stitches chain slip_stitch whip stitch running stitch gauge is not critical for this project this pattern is meant to be flexible enough to use most any size hook and yarn combination of your choosing thicker yarns work up most easily and quickly the larger your yarn the bigger your pumpkin will be if you choose a thinner yarn you may want to chain more stitches at the beginning if you want a larger pumpkin to compensate for the thinner yarn choose a hook and yarn combo where your stitches aren t so tight you can t work easily with them or so loose that the stuffing shows through the stitch gaps in the finished object a good rule of thumb is to note the hook size that your yarn label recommends and then go down a size or two from there if you would like a bigger or smaller pumpkin chain more or less stitches at the beginning this pattern is worked flat working and turning take care not to slip_stitch too tightly or your gauge will shrink up over the length of your project if you prefer you can single_crochet in the back loop rather than slip_stitch if you choose this option the vertical ridges on your pumpkin will be a bit farther apart"
