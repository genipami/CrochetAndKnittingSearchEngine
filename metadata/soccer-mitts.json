  "notes": "my daughter kept stealing my fingerless mitts so i knit her a pair that she could wear during her soccer practices and games and things.  since her hands are my size, now i can steal her pair ;)\r\n\r\nas written, this was perfect for a single skein of knit picks felici.  if you want a larger pair, you can add length to any area of the mitts and/or use a us 2 though your yardage will vary.\r\n\r\nthese are simple and quick to knit, featuring fitted thumb gussets and are thinner so you can wear them under sleeves without having to deal with things getting bunched up.\r\n\r\nenjoy :)",
