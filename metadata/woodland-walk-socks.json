  "notes": "is there anything more magical than a walk in the woods during winter right before the first snowfall. like the leaves falling from the trees as winter sets in and autumn says its last goodbye. the leaf pattern reminds me of just those leaves, once they have fallen and the woods are quiet and only the crunch of those leaves are under foot.\r\n\r\n \r\nthe pattern has an updated chart.   \r\n\r\n\r\nthis pattern has not been tech edited or test knit.\r\n",
