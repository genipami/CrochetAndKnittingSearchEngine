  "notes": "the daily beanie baby + kid is a classic ribbed hat perfect for keeping little ones warm for fall and winter. \r\n\r\nthis is a smaller version of the [adult size daily beanie][1], including two new sizes; baby and kid. it uses the same yarn weight and gauge as the original daily beanie, making it a cozy knit for children.\r\n\r\na great thing about this hat is that it's an amazing stash-buster! it is knit in a bulky weight yarn or equivalent combination of yarn weights held together (for example - 2 strands of worsted, or 2 strands of dk + 1 fingering). i include guidance on choosing different combinations of yarn weights in the pattern.\r\n\r\n***view on the stitch + scrap blog for free, or buy a printable, ad-free [pattern pdf on my etsy][2]***\r\n\r\n**sizing**\r\nbaby (kid) size to fit a head circumference of  14-16 in. / 35-40 cm (16-20 in. / 40-51 cm) head circumference.\r\n\r\n*note: kid size includes toddlers*\r\n\r\n**yardage and yarn choice**\r\nyardage: approximately 70-75 (90-95) yards of bulky weight (or equivalent) yarn for hat (with no pom poms). additional yarn leftovers, if available, for pom poms. \r\n\r\nthe hat is knit in a bulky weight or equivalent, meaning you can hold different yarn weights together to achieve the same gauge. here are a few of the combinations i have used to knit this hat: \r\n\r\n* 1 strand bulky (optional - add a fingering or lace strand for a thicker fabric)\r\n* 2 strands worsted\r\n* 2 strands dk + 1 fingering or 1 lace \r\n* 1 strand dk + 2 fingering + 1 lace \r\n\r\n**needles + notions **\r\n* 16” us size 10.5 (6.5mm) circular needle\r\n* us size 10.5 (6.5mm) double-pointed needles or longer circular needle for magic loop method (for crown of hat)\r\n* 6 (5) stitch markers, including one distinct bor marker \r\n* tapestry needle for sewing in ends\r\n* optional: pom pom maker\r\n\r\n**gauge**\r\n16 stitches and 17 rows = 4x4in./10x10cm (unstretched) blocked square in 2x2 rib, in the round, on size 10.5 (6.5mm) needle. \r\n\r\nwhen stretched horizontally, the stitch gauge increases to about 10 st/4in. the stretchiness of the 2x2 rib is what makes it a great fit for a range of children’s head sizes. \r\n\r\n**techniques used**\r\n* knit, purl\r\n* long tail or german twisted cast on\r\n* k2tog decrease\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/daily-beanie\r\n  [2]: https://www.etsy.com/listing/4407318779/daily-beanie-baby-kid-knitting-pattern"
