    "content": "this sock is a top down heel flap and gusset sock in a simple waffle pattern it is a great project for a beginner because it uses a lot of standard techniques but is fast to knit the waffle acts as ribbing which will accommodate a large range of foot sizes i wrote the pattern for my friend jack who really loves hand knit socks **updated january 28 2010** to include three sizes"
