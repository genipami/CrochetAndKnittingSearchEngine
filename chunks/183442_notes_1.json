    "content": "half-fingered gloves with an elegant pattern of leaves running up the back of the wrist and hand ribbed on the palm to fit most hand sizes and available in both a short and long version the leaf pattern is adapted from the traveling leaves pattern in 50 fabulous knit stitches by rita weiss two sizes are available large and small the large size can be too loose for many women so if you knit loosely or have small- to normal-sized wrists i d suggest using the directions for the small size"
