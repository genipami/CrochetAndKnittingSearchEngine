  "notes": "this pattern in for a small hat that fits twelve and fourteen inch baby dolls. the twelve inch doll i made it for was a corolle baby doll, the fourteen inch doll was a lullababy doll. i wasn't entirely happy with this project because the top of the hat ends up with a bit the hat that doesn't sit quite right. another thing to note is that the hook i used was actually handmade by a friend and may be a slightly different size then your hooks.\r\nmaterials needed:\r\n* loops and threads soft classic acrylic yarn in bright red\r\n* loops and threads soft classic acrylic yarn in off white\r\n* 5.00mm (h) crochet hook\r\n* stitch markers\r\n* tapestry needle\r\nyou only need a little bit of each color of yarn. perfect for scrap yarn projects.
