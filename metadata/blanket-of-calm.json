  "notes": "**if you'd like to join the cal** there is a thread in my ravelry group [here][1]. no drama allowed!\r\n\r\n*the blanket of calm* is a little gift from me to all of you who need a project to help cope with the worry we are experiencing right now with the pandemic. sometimes it’s nice to just sit and crochet a quick granny square when you can't focus on anything else. i was doing this myself when i suddenly realized that my random squares would add up to a blanket and i could produce something beautiful made up from moments of worry or distraction. so, while i don't have a finished blanket yet, i do have the directions for you to make one!\r\n\r\nif you prefer knitting, this is a great pandemic knitting pattern: [olive pink.][2]\r\n\r\nwe knitters (and maybe you hookers, too) have tons of scrap fingering weight yarn lying around so that is what my pattern is based on - but you can use any weight of yarn. please note that this is not my own invention, i just rewrote it in a way that might appeal to knitters. it is a solid granny square (that’s been around for donkey’s years) but looks great in a colorful array. \r\n\r\n**skills needed** - links to learn these techniques are given below.\r\nchain, single crochet, and double crochet.  with a bit of practice these  will become second nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n**here is a video** that i made - apologies that it's a bit blurry in places [here][3].  here is an alternative one [here][4] - these are for people who already know how to crochet. print out your pattern and use with the video.\r\n\r\n[here is a link][5] to the \"slip stitch join\" - in my opinion the simplest and most cosmetically appealing way to join your squares. note that you should join across before joining up and down. \r\n\r\n**learn to chain** [here][6]. note that reviews on crochet youtube videos are brutal. you must be patient and practice all of this and not expect to be perfect in a day.\r\n\r\n**learn to single crochet (sc)**  [here][7]. and once you've mastered single crochet, learn the double crochet - then you are ready!\r\n\r\n**learn to double crochet (dc)** [here][8].\r\n\r\n**yarn requirements**\r\nsmall throw\r\n42” x 51” \r\n14 squares wide x 17 squares long (238 squares)\r\n12/3g yards per 3\" square \r\n\r\n**large throw**\r\nfor a throw that is 51” x 64” \r\n17 squares wide x 21 squares long (336 squares) but you can alter it as you go to make it smaller if you like.\r\n12/3g yards per 3\" square\r\n\r\ni will be updating the pattern this weekend to show you how to attach the squares (which is simple and requires no seaming!)\r\n\r\nplease note that i cannot provide individual crochet instruction. \r\n\r\nif you'd like to join the crochet-a-long there is a thread in my ravelry group [here][9]. \r\n\r\nnote - random scrap yarn is used in pictures to the left, fingering weight on a us d hook. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ravelry.com/discuss/casapinka/topics/4020670\r\n  [2]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/olive-pink\r\n  [3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm633q1y_e8\r\n  [4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de-annzeylk\r\n  [5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdfnbethp0g\r\n  [6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v-mssy5rku\r\n  [7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgvokqcf5qw\r\n  [8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xkssksknzo\r\n  [9]: https://www.ravelry.com/discuss/casapinka/topics/4020670",
