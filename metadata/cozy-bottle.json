  "notes": "**cozy bottle** is a cover for your hot water bottle, making this warm winter companion just a bit more soft and cuddly while giving it a crisp and modern touch from it's plain and somewhat unpleasant rubbery look & feel. \r\n\r\n**cozy bottle**  is knit in a colourwork stitch design, with yarn from a country where they know how to keep warm: iceland.  there are two stitch patterns to choose from, both taken from the centuries old heritage of nordic knitting designs, but alive and kicking in bright colour combinations.  credits go to my favorite designer lucinda guy for inspiring this colourwork.  \r\n\r\nthis detailed pattern let's you knit this easily, and provides links to techniques used. if you're not familiar with judy's magic cast on, this is your chance to learn. at the given gauge the cozy knits up quicker than you'd think, most knitters spend under 8 hours. pattern comes with two chart versions. \r\n\r\nif things are unclear, please send me a message.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n**yardage**\r\n\r\nmc:  turquoise or pale red, 60 meters / 65 yds\r\ncc1: white, 45 meters / 50 yds\r\ncc2: black, 55 meters / 60 yds\r\ncc3: orange, or turquoise, or some leftover yarn, this requires only a very small amount of yarn. for the brave and handy ones, dye a few meters of the white yarn in orange (turquoise for 2nd version) or your prefered contrast colour.  \r\n\r\n--------------------------------",
