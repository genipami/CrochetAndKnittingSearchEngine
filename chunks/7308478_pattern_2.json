    "content": "doing french knots instead of beads for the center of the flower but mine looked awful so went with beads instead i imagine you could also use tiny dome shaped buttons casting on for the petals - the bottom of the petals where you start needs to be closed so you can cinch them together when you create the flower i find the easiest way to do this is to start with judy s magic cast on jmco you could also use the turkish cast on or close it later with mattress stitch or kitchener jmco is so handy to know for toe up socks or toys though i highly recommend you learn it for the leaves i also start them with jmco but since you are sewing them onto the backs of the petals you can just cast on and join in the round a closed cast on edge isn t necessary leaves - you are not making a full leaf you are just making the part that shows behind the petals and enough extra so you can sew it to the petals sewing on beads - when sewing on the beads your thread will have a tendency to catch on the tips of the flowers and leaves to minimize this annoying problem i usually sew beads onto the petals before i add the leaves thus reducing the annoying catching by half cast on tails - leave a long tail on all leaves for sewing for petals leave at least 2-3 long tails for sewing and to make a hanging loop poinsettias on parade j g miller designs page 2 of 6 small flower - make 5 petals gently weave in the tail and cut it don t yank on the tail or it will disort your nice point leaving a long tail for sewing and hanging loop on at least 2 of your petals cast on 6 stitches in red using make a total of 5 petals jmco or as desired see construction notes and work in the round make leaf size to match your flower round 1 k3 k3 small leaf - make 5 leaves round 2 k1 m1 k1 m1 k1 leaving a long tail for sewing cast on 10 stitches in small flower k1 m1 k1 m1 k1 green using jmco or as desired see construction notes and work in the round round 3 k5 k5 round 1 k5 k5 round 4 k1 m1 k3 m1 k1 small leaf small flower k1 m1 k3 m1 k1 round 2 k5 k5 round 5 k7 k7 small leaf round 3 k5 k5 after a few rounds i thread my tail to the right side of the work to show the beginning of the round small leaf round 4 k5 k5 round 6 k7 k7 small leaf round 7 k7 k7 round 5 k5 k5 round 8 k2tog k3 k2tog small leaf small flower k2tog k3 k2tog round 6 k5 k5 round 9 k5 k5 small leaf round"
