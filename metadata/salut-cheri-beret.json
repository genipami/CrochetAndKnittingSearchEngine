  "notes": "an easy and quick project, suitable for beginners. the beret is knitted in the round with stockinette stitch, from the bottom to the top. it has a rolled up edge in the bottom and an i-cord stem on top.\r\n\r\nthe name for the beret is from the t-shirt i was wearing when i took the project photos of the first beret for ravelry. i thought the name suited the beret, since it's quite classical take on the hat that has become the icon of everything french. happy knitting!"
