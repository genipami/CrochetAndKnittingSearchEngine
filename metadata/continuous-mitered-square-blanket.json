  "notes": "the continuous mitered square crochet afghan pattern has the charm of patchwork squares but is worked continuously so there is no fastening off after each square leaving you with a zillion ends to weave in ... yay! and the self striping yarn does all the colorwork for you so you can just sit back and stitch.\r\n\r\n"
