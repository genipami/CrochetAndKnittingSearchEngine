  "notes": "> this pattern is available for [free on my blog][1]. the downloadable pdf listed for sale contains the full pattern (including all photo tutorials and color chart), in one printable file without advertisements.\r\n\r\n**beginner friendly**\r\n\r\never since designing the gingerbread man kitchen towel, i’ve had many ask if i could design towels that hang in a similar way for year-round use. the floral blooms hand towel was the first in a fun, new series of crochet towels followed by the farmhouse striped keyhole hand towel. because crocheters loved the farmhouse striped keyhole hand towel, i decided to come up with an even more basic crochet towel design that is suitable for beginner crocheters.\r\n\r\n**yarn**\r\ni chose to use lily sugar n’ cream 100% worsted weight cotton yarn. lily sugar n’ cream is available in 39 colors so i was able to find all of the colors i needed for this project within the same yarn line.\r\n\r\ntowel is an a crocheted simplicity original design.\r\n\r\njoin the a crocheted simplicity crochet community group on facebook to stay up to date with new releases, giveaways, sales and testing opportunities: https://www.facebook.com/groups/906744872727855/\r\n\r\nyou can also find me on etsy (a crocheted simplicity) & love crafts.\r\n\r\nall of my patterns are written in standard american terms, unless noted otherwise.\r\n\r\nplease note that due to the nature of digital files i cannot take any refunds, however, i do offer customer support and will try my best to help you with the instructions.\r\n\r\n© 2022, designed by jennifer renaud aka a crocheted simplicity. all rights reserved.\r\n\r\nthis design, the pattern, and the images are property of a crocheted simplicity. the buyer may use this pattern for personal use and charity. sales of finished items are also permitted, credit given to a crocheted simplicity is greatly appreciated. no part of this document may be reproduced, altered, or distributed in any form, or by any means, without express written permission from jennifer renaud.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.acrochetedsimplicity.com/basic-crochet-keyhole-towel/"
