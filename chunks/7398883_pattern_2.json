    "content": "parts - upper and lower for me it is 60/2 = 30 stitches each we find 10 central loops on the bottom side mark them with markers 30 = 10 + 10 + 10 for 70 stitches round in total 35 = 11 + 13 + 11 for 80 stitches round in total 40 = 13 + 14 + 13 continue to knit round both parts of the sock and in every 2nd row we begin to form increases on the heel bottom side of the sock a slope to the right and a slope to the left on the right and left sides of markers respectively having knitted a sufficient depth along the heel equal to the oblique circumference of the foot we switch to rotary knitting in the same way as in a square heel - we remember the 10 13 14 central loops of the heel from which we made increases and begin to make decreases - in each front row on the left heel side we knit the 10th 13th 14th loop of the center of the heel together with the next one - and in each purl row on the left we knit the first loop of the center of the heel purl together with the next one we knit in turning row until we return to the original number of 30 35 40 loops on the bottom side of the sock foot we continue to knit round with a 4 by 1 \u00abbroken rib pattern\u00bb forming the desired length of the foot you should measure your foot length for it 3-7 cm before the start of the toe decreases we again switch to the jacquard pattern adding a red thread to the blue one and change the knitting needles to a larger one 2 5 mm at the end of the pattern we continue to knit the foot only in red until the beginning of the toe focusing on the foot length measurement toe we move on to the toe and change the knitting needles to a smaller size from the main one in this case 2 0 mm a band toe shape is quite similar to a classic ribbon toe shape but differs in that the number of loops per ribbon is allocated a little more and after the decreases are completed the ribbon loops on the left and right are sewn together with a loop-to-loop seam here i have allocated 8 loops on each side for the ribbons right and left rhythm of decreases from the total number of loops we take the whole number of tens if we have 60 loops then 6 / if we have 70 loops then 7 etc focusing on it we make the same number of decreases as tens we have on both sides of the band with 8 loops right and left in every 2nd row 4 decreases in row at all and when we finish them we begin to make decreases in each row"
