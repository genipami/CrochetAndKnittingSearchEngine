    "content": "circuit socks designed by cow from mars notes this sock features a simple mosaic pattern that reminds me of the many blibbities and blobbities these are undoubtedly the proper technical terms on a circuit board if you ve never tried mosaic knitting before you re missing out you only work with one colour at a time which makes for fantastic tv knitting and even though i made these socks for one of my largest-footed friends they flew off the needles in no time the instructions are for a sock that is worked cuff-down with a heel flap but the pattern can be adapted quite easily for toe-up and other types of heels there are 3 sizes small medium large with 60 72 84 stitches per round instructions are written and the mosaic pattern is both written and charted you may use any technique/needles you prefer for knitting a tube in the round supplies two colours of sock yarn with good contrast fingering weight wool/nylon mix - 75g main colour mc shown as blue in the charts - 50g contrast colour cc shown as white in the charts - in the sample socks the solid purple yarn is mc and the variegated yellow/orange/purple yarn is cc 2 5mm us1 5 needles or whatever size needed to obtain gauge stitch markers yarn needle abbreviations st s = stitch es bor = beginning of round mc = main colour shown as blue in the charts cc = contrast colour shown as white in the charts k = knit p = purl p2tog = purl 2 together k2tog = knit 2 together ssk = slip 1 knitwise slip 1 knitwise knit slipped stitches together through back loops sl = slip 1 stitch purlwise rs = right side ws = wrong side circuit socks v1 0 - cow from mars - 1 gauge my gauge was approximately 7 5 stitches and 10 row = 1 inch in mosaic pattern i normally knit socks at a tighter gauge 8 5 sts and 11 row but i adjusted my yarn and needle choice so that the medium size will fit a foot that measures 10 5 in circumference feel free to adjust your stitch gauge as needed row gauge does not matter when choosing a pattern size consider that the fit should be similar to that of a vanilla sock with the same stitch count both in terms of size and stretchiness chart instructions for the medium size both socks are identical for the small and large sizes the second sock needs to be mirrored to account for the asymmetry of having a half repeat on the instep the easiest way to do this is to start the chart at row 13 for the second sock rather than row 1 circuit socks v1 0 - cow from mars - 2 cuff using a stretchy cast-on of your choice cast on 60 72 84 sts in mc join for working in the round and add a bor marker"
