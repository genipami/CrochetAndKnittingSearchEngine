  "notes": "this fun fishy pattern was inspired by mc escher’s designs. the hat has a light and plush texture and a bit of a slouch on top. \r\n\r\nyarn requirements are:\r\n\r\n150 meters / 164 yards fingering weight yarn for color 1\r\n130 meters / 142 yards fingering weight yarn for color 2\r\n\r\nany fingering weight yarn will do.\r\n\r\ni would like to play around with color variation in the color 2 section of the pattern. you could make a tropical fish aquarium!\r\n\r\nthis is my first pattern and i would appreciate any feedback. thanks for giving it a try!",
