  "notes": "after getting sucked into animal crossing: new horizons, i wanted to make some nook leaf coasters, but there weren’t any crochet patterns out there so i made my own! these are super quick and easy to make with your leftover bits of green cotton yarn - you only need about 10-12 yards for each coaster.\r\n\r\nwith the 4mm hook and sugar ‘n cream yarn, it’s 4 inches long between the widest points, so it just fits a regular mug, but some of the bottom of the mug is over the cutout part of the leaf. if you want a larger coaster, you may want to use a heavier weight yarn and/or go up in hook size.\r\n\r\nyou can buy the formatted one-page pdf to print out and mark off, or you can use the free version on my website:\r\nhttps://belindamakes.com/crochet-patterns/nook-leaf-coaster/\r\n\r\nmake a [bell coaster][1] to go with it!\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/animal-crossing-bell-coaster"
