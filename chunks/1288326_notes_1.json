    "content": "this pattern uses the mosaic crochet technique and lots of bright colours to make a blanket that really does look like stained glass the squares are much simpler to work than they look and detailed instructions with photos are provided for each round all the squares are worked the same way but by varying the order in which the 21 colours are used no two squares look exactly the same there are 42 squares in the finished blanket which measures about 116 x 100 cm / 46 x 39 you will need 550g of black yarn and then something over 10g of each of 21 colours so this would be a good pattern to use up some of those leftovers of yarn i really enjoyed making this blanket and hope you will too all my ravelry patterns are free to download but if you enjoy them please consider making a donation to the british liver trust where the money will go to fund research and support the families of children with a liver disease you can do this easily by going to my fundraising page here 1 1 https //www justgiving com/page/frankie-brown"
